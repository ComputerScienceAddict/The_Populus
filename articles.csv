0,"As Trump Takes a Victory Lap, the Crypto Faithful Kiss the Ring",The crypto industry is celebrating the return of Donald Trump to the White House in anticipation of an easier ride under his regime.,https://www.wired.com/story/trump-crypto-support/,"The denizens of cryptoland have erupted into celebration and gleeful told-you-so's after Donald Trump, the self-styled “crypto president,” was voted back into the White House on Wednesday morning. Under the Democratic administration led by President Joe Biden, crypto companies have felt they were being singled out for persecution by US financial regulators and denied access to essential services like banking. Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris, the current vice president, was viewed by the crypto faithful as complicit by proximity and likely to replicate this strategy. (Harris never declared her intentions towards the crypto industry.) But a victory for Trump marks the start of a promising new chapter, they say. “This election was completely existential for crypto in the US,” claims Nic Carter, a general partner at crypto-focused VC firm Castle Island Ventures. “The first [response] is relief. We have been trying to build businesses with one hand tied behind our backs. I can’t emphasize how hard that is.” Under Trump, the industry expects a far friendlier reception from regulators, says Carter, as well as legislation that sets out specific rules for crypto firms. And if Trump incorporates bitcoin into the US government’s balance sheet, advocates speculate it could stoke demand for bitcoin among other world powers, thereby further inflating the price, which rose to record heights after Trump’s victory was confirmed. In short, to them, everything is coming up Milhouse. “Just ceasing the hostilities would have been immensely positive, but we got something better: a candidate that is overtly pro-crypto,” says Carter. “Last night could not have gone any better.” Some of crypto’s largest companies—among them crypto exchange Coinbase and stablecoin issuer Circle—have insisted during the 2024 election cycle that crypto need not become a partisan issue. But crypto figureheads largely lined up behind the Republican candidate: Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, cofounders of crypto platform Gemini, each donated $1 million to Trump, as did Jesse Powell, cofounder of the Kraken exchange. Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, whose VC firm a16z has invested billions of dollars in crypto startups, publicly endorsed Trump for the presidency. “We are on the brink of a new American Renaissance,” wrote Tyler Winklevoss in a post on X, after it became clear that Trump had beaten Harris. On the campaign trail, Trump went out of his way to court their favor. In July, speaking to thousands of bitcoiners at a conference in Nashville, Tennessee, Trump duly sang from the bitcoin hymn sheet, promising to cement the US as the foremost bitcoin mining powerhouse, establish a national “bitcoin stockpile,” and appoint a bitcoin advisory council if reelected. Trump claimed he would turn the US into the “crypto capital of the planet.” In October, Trump went as far as to launch his own crypto platform, World Liberty Financial, which his family has marketed as a way to “make finance great again.” The platform is set to provide peer-to-peer borrowing and lending services of some flavor, though the Trumps have provided few hard details. “If you were a single-issue voter that cares about the growth of sound money through bitcoin, Trump was the clear choice,” says Peter McCormack, host of the podcast What Bitcoin Did. By contrast, Harris’ Democratic platform for 2024 did not include any mention of crypto, and she made only a single reference to crypto on the campaign trail, in a pitch to donors in New York City, Bloomberg reported. ""We will encourage innovative technologies like AI and digital assets while protecting consumers and investors. We will create a safe business environment with consistent and transparent rules of the road,” Harris is quoted as saying. Reticence in the Harris camp to take a public stance on crypto was interpreted by industry members as a signal that her presidency would represent a continuation of the bad old times under Biden. “We saw no evidence that she was going to moderate the stance at all,” says Carter. Democrat-supporting members of the crypto industry were left in an awkward position; though they aligned with Harris’ politics, it was conceivable that victory for Trump would be a more beneficial outcome for the sector. “As a crypto entrepreneur, I’m excited about the prospect of a bull market,” says Jonathan Padilla, one of the organizers of Crypto4Harris, a coalition of left-leaning members of the crypto industry. “For crypto in isolation, Trump is probably going to be the much quicker shot of sugar,” says Padilla, even if the president later loses interest. Although the failure to make a persuasive pitch to the crypto electorate is surely not to blame for Harris losing the presidential race to Trump, concedes Padilla, the crypto industry was able to mobilize its capital to put a finger on the political scale. During the 2024 cycle, crypto firms donated hundreds of millions of dollars to three crypto-friendly super political action committees (PACs)—Fairshake, Protect Progress, and Defend American Jobs—the aim of which was to support crypto-friendly congressional candidates and dislodge the industry’s most vociferous critics. The fruits of that investment became clear on Wednesday. In Ohio, incumbent Democratic senator Sherrod Brown, who is depicted as an arch-villain in crypto circles, was unseated by Republican Bernie Moreno. Through Defend American Jobs, the crypto industry spent more than $40 million in support of Moreno. Meanwhile, according to Stand With Crypto, a nonprofit pushing for bespoke crypto regulation in the US, more than 250 pro-crypto representatives have been elected to Congress. “If there’s one thing that crypto probably will have done very effectively it is influence the House,” says Padilla. With Trump in the Oval Office, the industry expects to benefit from further opportunities to access the corridors of power. Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer and head of global policy at Circle, believes that a Trump government will allow his business to advise on policy in the same way it does in the rest of the world. “My hope and expectation is that we would have equal access to an incoming Trump administration,” says Disparte. Though change will inevitably be gradual, crypto has earned a “victory lap,” says Disparte. “I’m very confident that 2025 can be a breakthrough year.”",http://localhost:5000/images/image_0.jpg,C:\Users\compu\Documents\Civitas\flask-server\downloaded_images\image_0.jpg,Crypto
1,"Meet ZachXBT, the Masked Vigilante Tracking Down Billions in Crypto Scams and Thefts","He just untangled a $243 million bitcoin theft, what may be the biggest-ever crypto heist to target a single victim. And he has never shown his face.",https://www.wired.com/story/meet-zachxbt-243-million-crypto-theft/,"On August 19, a twentysomething man who goes by the online handle ZachXBT was walking into an airport to board a flight home—which airport, his real name, where home is, he’d rather not say—when he saw an alert on his phone. A sum of bitcoins had just been transferred to a small cryptocurrency exchange, one of many whose transactions he constantly monitors on Bitcoin’s blockchain for signs of criminal money laundering. The alert piqued his interest: This transaction was worth around $600,000, a cash-out of funds that was easily 10 times bigger than the typical trade on that service. When he reached his gate, another ping alerted him to a second transaction on the same exchange worth more than $1 million. Then one for $2 million. As he stood in line to board his plane, ZachXBT hurriedly traced the money on his phone, following it backward in time from one Bitcoin address to another, flagging the suspicious funds and racing to find their origin before the half hour of internet blackout between wheels-up and the plane's Wi-Fi coming online. Before he was in the air, he had determined that the money had come from a crypto wallet that had held hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin that hadn't moved since 2012—and that this nine-figure mountain of money was now being hurriedly liquidated at exchanges with high transaction costs that no patient, decade-plus Bitcoin investor would accept. To ZachXBT, the flow of funds immediately looked instead like a giant theft. In fact, as he double-checked his findings, it appeared that someone had stolen around $243 million worth of Bitcoin from one unlucky victim, perhaps the biggest known crypto heist ever to target an individual. “It was such an abnormally large amount stolen from a single person,” ZachXBT tells WIRED. “I had to make sure I wasn't crazy.” Once he was above 10,000 feet with working Wi-Fi, ZachXBT began to trace more outflows of the stolen funds as they were passed through one exchange and coin-swapping service after another. Over the next hours, he raced to graph out the branching money movements as the thieves transferred the coins through more than a dozen of those platforms in an apparent attempt at obfuscating their path. As he followed that trail back to whoever had lost the bitcoins, ZachXBT could see that a portion of the funds had originally come from the now-defunct Genesis cryptocurrency exchange. He direct-messaged the exchange's administrators on X and asked them to put him in touch with the victim, who would ultimately hire him to hunt for the stolen money. By the time his flight had landed, ZachXBT had come to see that there were three main threads of the stolen funds—going to what he believed were three likely culprits. He had also posted a message to his more than 650,000 followers on X, pointing out the theft in progress on the blockchain. He would soon be rewarded with a message from a source who claimed to have clues of the thieves' identities. Over the next week, working on the case day and night, sleeping no more than four or five hours at a time, and periodically sharing his findings with law enforcement agencies, ZachXBT would identify the alleged suspects behind the theft—two young hackers named Malone Lam and Jeandiel Serrano, both in their early twenties. (ZachXBT also identified another alleged hacker whom WIRED has chosen not to publicly name because the individual hasn't been arrested or charged.) He even obtained a video recording that he says shows one of their screens as the theft was completed and they celebrated their enormous windfall. In his whirlwind investigation, ZachXBT went so far as to track the alleged suspects on Instagram and TikTok, watching one of them blow millions on cars, private jets, and clubs where the alleged culprit spent as much as $500,000 a night. Less than a month after the alert pinged ZachXBT's phone on the plane, two out of three suspected thieves would be arrested and criminally charged. When ZachXBT finally saw the mug shot of one of the alleged hackers, he says he felt a brief rush of adrenaline. But it passed quickly. “I didn't really feel any special sense of accomplishment,” ZachXBT says. “I was just treating it as any other case.” If tracing a quarter-billion-dollar theft feels to ZachXBT like just another day on the internet, that's perhaps because he has distinguished himself over the past three years as the most prolific independent crypto-focused detective in the world. Since he began his work as an amateur investigator in 2021, he has traced billions of dollars in stolen funds and scams. By his own count—which he broke down for WIRED in a spreadsheet—his hundreds of investigations have directly led to the recovery of around $210 million worth of criminal crypto proceeds, as well as another $225 million in seized funds he had at least some less-direct hand in helping to claw back for victims. He has called out influencers promoting coins in pump-and-dump schemes, hunted down cybercriminals behind massive crypto heists, and revealed dozens of incidents of North Korean hackers breaching crypto firms or even infiltrating those companies as employees. Throughout all of it, he has been funded almost entirely by cryptocurrency donations in the forms of grants from cryptocurrency organizations and payments from strangers who send contributions to an address he lists in his social media profiles, adding up to around $1.3 million since 2021. “He's a new generation of investigator. He works for the people,” says Joe McGill, an analyst at the Secret Service who has collaborated with ZachXBT. “His success is completely tied to the success of his investigations.” Since ZachXBT began pursuing his career as a crypto vigilante, he has also kept his mask firmly in place. Online, he appears only as his avatar, a kind of platypus cartoon figure in a detective's trench coat or sometimes a hoodie. To avoid retaliation from his many enemies in the world of crypto criminals and con artists, he has never publicly shown his face nor revealed his real name or exact age. He would only speak to WIRED on the condition that I not try to dig up those identifying details. On some of their early conference calls, McGill says, ZachXBT would not only keep his camera off but even use a voice-changer application, sometimes sounding like a high-pitched “South Park character,” as McGill puts it, or on other occasions deepening his voice's pitch until it reminded him of something out of a horror film. “It was very odd, initially,” says McGill, who at the time worked at the crypto-tracing firm TRM Labs. “But I respected his privacy, because this anonymous guy was doing really great work.” ZachXBT exposes so many crypto criminal scams and thefts on a near-weekly basis, often working far faster than law enforcement agencies, says Nick Bax, a cryptocurrency investigator and founder of the firm Five I's, that Bax has wondered half-jokingly if he might be some kind of bot. “He is a machine,” Bax says. As part of one investigation last year where they collaborated to trace a $60 million theft from a crypto project called AnubisDAO in 2021, Bax gave ZachXBT a list of 500 transactions on a Saturday night, each of which needed to be manually analyzed along with all its connected blockchain addresses. “I figured that would keep him busy for at least a few days,” Bax says. Instead, by early the next afternoon, ZachXBT had gone through every transaction and identified which ones were tied to the theft. “I was shocked,” Bax says. “He definitely had to have been on his computer for 12 hours straight.” Many of the results of ZachXBT's investigations are unceremoniously posted to his account on X. Over time, however, his findings have increasingly gained attention from law enforcement agencies—several of which he now often shares his findings with prior to publication. The result has been real and growing consequences for the targets of that detective work. “As Zach has gotten bigger, there have been financial repercussions and legal repercussions,” says Taylor Monahan, a security researcher at crypto firm MetaMask and one of ZachXBT's closest collaborators on investigations, including the $243 million theft case. “If Zach posts a thread about someone now, and it's a good one, that person is going to get arrested.” So how has ZachXBT managed to outrace and out-trace even law enforcement's crypto investigators, despite having no formal training or organizational support? Even he isn't entirely sure. “That's a tough question. I don't know why I'm good,” ZachXBT tells WIRED in a phone interview. He chalks it up to a willingness to work around the clock—crypto markets never close, after all—and a familiarity with analyzing cryptocurrency blockchains that comes from years of poring over those vast ledgers of transactions. “The more you look at the blockchain, like when you eat, sleep, and breathe it, it starts to make more sense over time,” he says. “You can just start to pick up on those connections. I can look at a wallet, and I can profile it and tell you if it's a bad actor within seconds.” ZachXBT says that familiarity with blockchains comes from his years of experience as a crypto enthusiast and trader—and as a victim himself of some of the crypto economy's many traps for unwary investors. Around 2017, he says, he was naively buying thousands of dollars worth of crypto tokens that would all eventually tank in value—often due to so-called “rug pulls,” when a crypto token's creator sells off their holdings and all the other investors are left with a worthless asset. “I was buying in like, ‘This is going to change the world.' I just held it and never sold,” ZachXBT says. As a result, he says, “I was the person getting scammed.” By 2018, not only had all those investments cratered, but an Electrum crypto wallet that ZachXBT used was hacked with a malicious software update. He lost close to $15,000 more. Only at that point did he decide to take a step back and rethink his approach. Instead of simply buying and holding tokens, he began analyzing cryptocurrencies' blockchains—almost all of which are publicly visible to anyone who can decipher the owner of different addresses—to see how larger, more successful investors were trading tokens and coins, then to try to emulate their moves. As a result of that blockchain analysis, he was familiar enough by 2020 with tracing crypto transactions to be able to spot scams in progress that weren't visible to the average investor. He'd see an influencer publicly promoting a crypto asset to their hundreds of thousands of followers, boosting its price, and then follow their funds on a blockchain to see that they were actually selling their own holdings immediately afterward in what often seemed to be a classic pump-and-dump scheme. “It was more like being a whistleblower,” ZachXBT says. “I'd notice that activity and think, ‘This kind of reminds me of what I fell for back in 2017 and 2018. Why not make a post about it?’ And that started to blow up.” When the NFT craze kicked off later that year, ZachXBT began similarly scrutinizing NFT projects like Bored Bunny and Billionaire Dogs Club to show where the money flowing into them was really going. Some of those NFT sellers would raise millions with little more than cartoon .jpg images, promising that the NFTs created from them would confer perks like entry to exclusive events or clubs. Instead, ZachXBT could see through blockchain analysis that the sellers were simply dividing and pocketing the funds. Sometimes, he'd even discover through crypto tracing that an NFT seller was, in fact, a rebrand of an earlier project that had already proven to be a scam. In some of those instances, ZachXBT's posts about NFT sellers did manage to scare off buyers and prevent shady NFT dealers from selling their wares. But over time, he grew bored of uncovering the same often transparent hustles run again and again, and frustrated with the lack of more concrete results: No one linked to the NFT projects he exposed faced criminal charges. Then, in early 2022, he began to notice that a group of hackers were taking over the Twitter accounts of high-profile crypto users and posting phishing links to Ethereum smart contracts designed to drain users' wallets, resulting in tens of millions of dollars in thefts. Whenever a devastated victim posted that their savings had been stolen, ZachXBT would make contact with them and then meticulously trace out the funds they'd lost. He combined those blockchain clues with sources he'd begun to develop in the Discord and Telegram channels frequented by young crypto thieves, which led him to a few online handles of teenagers who seemed to be behind the phishing campaign and were bragging about their massive scores. By this point, ZachXBT had become notorious enough in the crypto underworld that one person he believed to be a suspect had even included an apparent taunt about “mr xbt” in a Twitter post boasting about a diamond-encrusted Audemars Piguet wristwatch he'd bought. ZachXBT tracked down the watch seller in a luxury watch Discord channel and convinced the vendor, who had sold the timepiece for close to $50,000, to turn over the teenager's shipping address and real name. No public records appear to document whether the alleged thieves' were arrested—possibly because the suspects were minors and the charges have either been sealed or were never filed. But ZachXBT found a forfeiture notice showing that in October of 2022, a month after ZachXBT posted his findings on X, the FBI seized more than $200,000 worth of crypto assets from the teen suspect he’d identified—and the diamond watch. That same year, ZachXBT used similar techniques to trace another $2.5 million worth of NFTs stolen through a different phishing campaign to an alleged pair of French hackers. In that case, French prosecutors arrested five suspects a couple of months later and, according to Agence France-Presse, specifically credited ZachXBT's thread posted to X for aiding in their investigation into the two alleged ringleaders. “To see law enforcement acting on something I'd shared, that was very fulfilling,” ZachXBT says. “It made me think maybe I was actually onto something with what I'd been doing.” In the two years since first gaining law enforcement's attention, the scale—and, in some cases, the consequences—of ZachXBT's investigations has exploded. In February of 2023, he tracked down nearly $9 million in funds stolen from the crypto project Platypus, identifying one of the alleged thieves in a matter of hours; French police arrested two suspects just over a week later. Though the charges against the pair would ultimately be dropped, police recovered several million dollars in funds, and Platypus thanked ZachXBT in a tweet. Later that year, he traced a $25 million theft from crypto firm Uranium Finance, much of which appeared to have been laundered through the purchase of rare Magic: The Gathering cards. When the cybercriminal group known as Scattered Spider carried out a ransomware attack against Caesar's Entertainment in Las Vegas that extorted $15 million from the company, ZachXBT helped to trace and recover $12 million of the funds, according to other investigators who worked on the case and spoke with WIRED. Around the same time, ZachXBT published the results of a massive collection of investigations into 25 crypto thefts carried out by North Korea hackers totaling more than $200 million, about $7 million of which he'd helped to freeze. Around half of the hacks had never before been publicly revealed. He followed up that investigation with another that exposed a web of around 30 North Korean IT workers who had infiltrated tech companies and were being paid in cryptocurrency. In one case, one of those tech workers who seemed to be linked to North Korea had gotten hired at the NFT firm Munchables and had managed to steal $62 million in crypto assets from the company. When ZachXBT helped to identify and flag the funds, the spotlight on the thief made the money so hard to liquidate that they simply gave it back. Even so, when ZachXBT got the text alerts in the airport that put him onto the trail of $243 million taken from a single victim on August 19, it was one of the biggest thefts he'd ever chased. When he got back home from his international flight, he continued to follow those branching funds for days while monitoring social media for signs of his three suspects, two of whom went by the handles Greavys and Box. Greavys in particular—whose real name was Malone Lam and who appeared to be in Miami—was posting and appearing in photos of luxury real estate, diamond watches, jets, and sports cars including a Lamborghini Revuelto and a Pagani Huayra, the latter of which typically sells for more than $3 million. ZachXBT found posts from influencers to whom Greavys had gifted Birkin and Hermès purses worth between $30,000 and $50,000 each, and pictures of electric signs in a nightclub carried by servers that read, “WHO WANT A BIRK,” tagged with his name. “It seemed like all they did was just party and steal money,” ZachXBT says. Within a few days, he'd persuaded the source who'd first DMed him during his flight to send him a video of a screenshare among the three hackers who appeared to be involved in the theft. Unbeknownst to them, one of the alleged hackers had re-shared his screen during that screenshare with another group of friends—and one of them appears to have recorded it. Several times in the 90-minute video, ZachXBT says, the three hackers refer to each other by their first names. At another point, one of the three men also briefly flashed his Windows home screen, revealing his last name, too. The video even captures the moment of the alleged hackers’ delirious reaction to pulling off a nine-figure theft. “Oh my god! Oh my god! 243 million dollars! Yes!” one of them says in the recording. “I’m going to spaz out! Yo! We’re done. We’re done. I'm spazzing out. Do you know how much money that is?” Late in the afternoon on September 18, just shy of a month after ZachXBT's investigation began, Lam was arrested in Miami at a waterfront rental property for which he was paying $68,000 a month. Box—whose real name is Jeandiel Serrano—was taken into custody in the Los Angeles airport while flying home from a vacation in the Maldives with his girlfriend. According to prosecutors, he was wearing a $500,000 watch at the time of his arrest, was renting a house near LA for more than $40,000 a month, and had spent $1 million on luxury cars. The next day, wire fraud and money laundering charges against both Lam and Serrano were unsealed. According to court documents, both hackers had confessed to law enforcement investigators that they participated in multiple crypto thefts. Lam specifically admitted that the profits from them had funded his purchases of no fewer than 31 high-end cars. So far, $79 million of the $243 million they allegedly stole has been seized or frozen. ZachXBT is hopeful that more of the money will still be found. Prosecutors say that more than $100 million remains unaccounted for, even after the alleged hackers’ spending spree. ZachXBT’s third suspect, who appears to live in Connecticut, based on public records, has yet to be charged with any crime. Reporter Brian Krebs has pointed to a criminal complaint, however, that describes how a group of men allegedly carjacked a Connecticut couple in their fifties in a Lamborghini four days after the $243 million theft in late August and briefly kidnapped them because the carjackers “believed the victims’ son had access to significant amounts of digital currency”—suggesting that the victims may have been the parents of the third alleged recipient of the funds ZachXBT had traced. For ZachXBT, the investigation may be a kind of turning point. For the first time, he was retained by the victim in the case and was paid for his skills rather than working as a volunteer for donations. He says he may transition to doing more of that paid work or even start his own investigations firm. But he maintains that he's still not out to get rich from his exposés. “I see money seized, money returned to victims, people arrested, and that's my goal. That's what I set out to do,” ZachXBT says. “To see that it's benefiting people. That's what I get my gratification from.” His collaborator, Taylor Monahan of crypto wallet firm MetaMask, who has now worked with him on dozens of investigations, says she believes ZachXBT is still driven largely by a sense of justice—the kind that comes from once having been a victim of the crypto world's cruelty himself, and wanting to prevent that same outcome for others. “He had the same experience that so many people in this space have had, which is that something bad happens, and everyone around you says, ‘Sucks for you,’” Monahan says. “He viscerally rejects that experience. And he wants to change it.”",http://localhost:5000/images/image_1.jpg,C:\Users\compu\Documents\Civitas\flask-server\downloaded_images\image_1.jpg,Crypto
2,"In the Kentucky Mountains, a Bitcoin Mining Dream Becomes the Stuff of Nightmares","When bitcoin was on a hot streak, owners of small industrial facilities in Kentucky struck up crypto mining partnerships with Chinese companies. Then things fell apart.",https://www.wired.com/story/in-the-kentucky-mountains-a-bitcoin-mining-dream-becomes-the-stuff-of-nightmares/,"On a dead-end road that climbs out of the tiny city of Jenkins, in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains in Eastern Kentucky, there stands a large warehouse with a mint green roof. It shares the road with a few other businesses, but is otherwise surrounded by an expanse of open fields and tree-lined slopes. Inside, the warehouse is stacked high with racks on racks of computers—thousands of them. But none have ever been switched on. The warehouse is owned by Mohawk Energy, a company cofounded by Kentucky state senator Brandon Smith in 2005, originally to resculpt landscapes disfigured by coal mining. After lying dormant for a period, Mohawk was reincarnated in 2022 when Smith struck a deal with HBTPower, a company then owned by Chinese crypto exchange Huobi, which wanted to use the warehouse for a bitcoin mining operation. Under the deal, Mohawk promised to fit up its warehouse with the necessary power infrastructure and repair any equipment that went down. In return, HBT would pay Mohawk a monthly hosting fee, a cut of its mining revenue, and the associated energy bills. Smith says he hoped the arrangement would generate tax revenue and create jobs for former coal miners, who could be trained as repair technicians. The coal industry departed Jenkins long ago, the reserves depleted, leaving people in search of work. More than a third now live below the poverty line, per the latest census data. “I liked the idea of going from one type of mining to a new type,” says Smith. “I thought, now in Eastern Kentucky we are going to have our time—we’re going to catch up and play a part in the tech future.” But after a promising start, the relationship between Mohawk and HBT soured and then fell apart. “Nothing has ever been turned on. It’s a fascinating, almost Willy Wonka–type atmosphere when you walk through,” says Smith. “It has turned into a disaster.” In November 2023, HBT brought a lawsuit in federal court, alleging that Mohawk had breached its contract on several fronts, including by failing to install the appropriate power infrastructure and secure certain power subsidies, and attempting to sell off the mining equipment. “Ultimately, the source of the current dispute is Mohawk’s basic failure to comply with its obligations, not only in a timely way, but at all in many regards,” says Harout Samra, a specialist in international dispute resolution at law firm DLA Piper and representative for HBT. Mohawk sued HBT in return, contesting the various alleged breaches and claiming that HBT is delinquent on more than $700,000 in rent, labor, and fit-up costs. The company is also seeking damages relating to the loss of income over the term of the contract and the inability to bring a new tenant into the facility while the equipment remains on-site. “Huobi simply made a bargain it believes now is a bad one, and wants to get out of it without paying the funds it owes,” the filing states. The legal conflict, which remains unresolved, is just one in a series of fights between Chinese companies and the owners of industrial facilities in the rural US over failed bitcoin mining partnerships. What looked to facility owners in Kentucky like an irresistible opportunity to tap into a new line of business in an otherwise fallow period has turned into a nightmare. They claim to have been saddled with unpaid hosting fees and energy bills worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, with few options for recovering the money. The Chinese parties have been left equally displeased. “HBTPower obviously regrets that this opportunity has ultimately played out the way it has,” says Samra. The bitcoin mining game—a race between computers to win the right to process a bundle of transactions and claim a crypto reward—is dominated by large corporations that own and operate industrial-scale facilities. But in 2021 and 2022, smaller-scale operations began to proliferate in the US countryside wherever there was available power, including in Kentucky. “A lot of mom-and-pop shops opened up,” says Phil Harvey, CEO at Sabre56, a firm that consults on crypto mining projects and operates its own facilities. “Appalachia has always been a good source of power.” These small facilities were plugging a gap in the market. A ban on crypto mining in China had left businesses casting about for a new home for their many millions of dollars’ worth of mining equipment. “A lot of wealthy Chinese businesses were affected,” says Harvey. “Every minute these machines are down, they are losing revenue.” Meanwhile, as the price of bitcoin ballooned—and the profitability of mining along with it—mining firms and investor groups began to hoard large quantities of bitcoin mining equipment of their own, says Harvey, without considering where they might deploy it. In an overheated market, holders of mining equipment jumped into hosting arrangements at short notice with owners of small facilities, some of whom had no prior experience and insufficient expertise, who agreed to install the equipment and run the mining operations on their behalf. But the haste with which these hosting relationships came together, in the name of striking while bitcoin was hot, says Harvey, set many of the partnerships up for failure. There was limited due diligence conducted by parties on both sides, delays in kitting out facilities and deploying equipment, and disputes over payment terms, he says, among other points of friction. “It's a snowball effect where everyone just ends up getting pissed off with each other,” says Harvey. Though the American market proved more expensive and bureaucratic than some Chinese businesses expected, says Harvey, problems were also caused by the hubris of facility owners, some of whom found themselves in over their heads. “It’s no joke running a [bitcoin mining] operation of any kind of scale,” he says. “Just because the Chinese are tough to do business with, doesn’t mean they are the ones in the wrong. I would say that blame is equally shared.” The law firm acting for Mohawk in its dispute with HBT, Anna Whites Law Office, has represented multiple owners of small facilities in Kentucky in similar legal conflicts with Chinese partners. The cases differ from the Mohawk situation, says attorney Anna Whites, founder of the firm, but share a common thread: “We saw a pattern that [companies with ties to China] would ship in machines with uncertain provenance, mine very heavily for three months, then run without paying the bill,” she claims. Some of the cases settled out of court; Whites is unable to supply the details for reasons of client confidentiality. But others continue to drag on. Biofuel Mining, a company formerly co-owned by Smith, is involved in legal tangles with two companies that Whites believes to be run out of China: Touzi Tech and VCV Power Gamma. Although both are incorporated in Delaware, per SEC filings, they conduct business in Mandarin and cannot be reached at their listed US addresses, Whites claims. “It's pretty standard for the foreign entities from any country to get a short-term office so that they have less scrutiny from US investors and government agencies,” she says. In both cases, Biofuel claims, the firms shipped equipment from China to its hosting facility in Eastern Kentucky, then walked away with the bitcoin produced, leaving behind hundreds of thousands of dollars in unpaid energy bills and hosting fees. Biofuel reached a settlement with Touzi in early 2022 for $60,000, but despite having handed back the mining equipment, it claims not to have received the sum it is owed under the agreement. In the still-unresolved spat with VCV, Biofuel received permission from the Martin County Circuit Court in Kentucky to sell off the mining equipment, claims Whites, to recoup a portion of the funds it is owed (she has not confirmed the amount), but she alleges that no damages have yet been awarded. VCV has stopped responding to communications, she claims. Biofuel has since dissolved, put out of business by the failed hosting ventures. “I literally lost my house—I lost everything. It financially ruined me,” says Wes Hamilton, former Biofuel Mining CEO. “I’m just so frustrated about the whole thing.” WIRED contacted VCV and Touzi for comment, but did not receive any response. There are few financial recovery options for companies like Mohawk and Biofuel. The situation is made more difficult, as in the Mohawk case, if they are dealing with so-called special purpose entities. Because they are set up by their parent companies for a single specific business venture, these entities need not be concerned about their long-term ability to operate in the US. “It certainly can be more difficult to recover damages from a non-US counterparty,” says Kim Havlin, a partner in the global commercial litigation practice at law firm White & Case. “There is certainly a risk that an entity that doesn’t need to be in the US may just ignore the case.” Even if the Kentucky facility owners win out in court, it could be difficult to collect any damages awarded. “A judgment is essentially a piece of paper. Any judgment needs to be turned into assets or cash in order to be valuable,” says Havlin. If the opposing party refuses to pay up and has no US assets to collect against, sometimes that isn’t possible. Almost a year after the dispute began, the Mohawk case is stuck in legal limbo. In a setback for Mohawk, the presiding judge recently denied its motion to dismiss HBT’s complaint, on the basis that it had failed to sufficiently back up its argument. The judge also pushed Mohawk’s countersuit into arbitration, a forum for resolving disputes privately instead of in open court. Non-US parties tend to prefer arbitration as a way to “remove a home forum from both sides,” explains Havlin. “You can pick an arbitral seat in neither country as a means of creating a neutral playing field.” A parallel federal court hearing is set for December to consider whether an injunction should be imposed on Mohawk, preventing it from selling off the remaining HBT equipment in its possession. Smith has given up on the idea of recovering the full amount he claims to be owed. “We’re at the point that it’s almost silly to even be arguing about breaking even,” he says. In an interview with PBS that aired in September 2023, touting the Mohawk Energy facility, Smith said he hoped to prove that not every business that blew into Jenkins would abandon the area. “I’ve stood at their ribbon cuttings, then watched them leave. I’d like to do something to let people know that not everybody is like that,” he said. After the relationship with HBT collapsed last year, Smith faces the prospect of Mohawk becoming yet another false start. With the facility inactive, the company has been forced to dismiss the former coal miners brought on as technicians. (It is unclear how many people it employed.) The Mohawk facility was perhaps never set to revitalize Jenkins in the way Smith hoped, anyway. “I would say that a rural community benefits very little from a bitcoin mining facility. In terms of job creation, it’s minimal in a lot of cases,” says Harvey, the consultant. “It's certainly not the savior to a dwindling community.” Nonetheless, Smith remains hopeful of salvaging the crypto mining project, with a new partner. “I’m hoping that this gets settled in the way that it should and that somebody comes forward and lets us go through with the vision that we wanted for this region,” he says. “I hope every day that maybe some big company will see that there's a place ready to go in this part of the country.” Otherwise, Mohawk’s dalliance with bitcoin mining will become a cautionary tale. “It was very hurtful to see these families lose their income. We were one of the biggest payrolls in Jenkins,” says Smith. “It adds insult to injury that I’m sitting here arguing in court.” Correction: 10/23/2024 11 AM EDT: The piece has been updated to clarify Mohawk's day to day responsibilities with regards to equipment maintenance.",http://localhost:5000/images/image_2.jpg,C:\Users\compu\Documents\Civitas\flask-server\downloaded_images\image_2.jpg,Crypto
3,The future of crypto regulation comes down to one unpopular man,"As part of his overtures to the crypto industry, Donald Trump has promised to fire embattled SEC chair Gary Gensler on ‘day one.’",https://www.theverge.com/24280387/gary-gensler-sec-chair-presidential-election-2024,"By  Elizabeth Lopatto, a reporter who writes about tech, money, and human behavior. She joined The Verge in 2014 as science editor. Previously, she was a reporter at Bloomberg.  It is my personal belief that no normal person should know the name of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s chair, and yet here I am, about to explain why he’s been an issue in the 2024 presidential election. The man in question is Gary Gensler, an economist who formerly worked at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. As SEC chair, he has been on the receiving end of death threats. Former President and current Republican nominee Donald Trump made a campaign promise to “fire Gary Gensler” to the raucous approval of a packed arena at this year’s Bitcoin Conference. Though blockchain enthusiasts have been the most vocal in their displeasure, the controversy around Gensler isn’t limited to them. The Economist has dubbed Gensler “the most controversial man in American finance”; House Democrats and Republicans have expressed “stern displeasure” on Gensler’s crypto approach. You could say he is unpopular. Many industries dislike their regulators. It is arguably the job of the SEC commissioner to be somewhat unpopular! And the cryptocurrency industry’s revulsion for Gensler is unsurprising after a series of SEC enforcements, including against major companies and exchanges. But Gensler himself became a contentious, oddly partisan issue on the level of presidential politics. And the story gets more complicated from there because this is not a cut-and-dried case of a regulator being persecuted by the industry for doing his job. Gensler is also unpopular among his own staff, though not for any reasons that will get thousands of people roaring inside a convention center.  It’s unusual for the SEC to be a hot-button issue — even during the 2008 financial crisis, the SEC chair wasn’t exactly a well-known figure. (The chair at the time was Christopher Cox. Yes, literally who.) But the SEC has become politically heated because Gensler wanted it to be, says Adam Pritchard, a professor of securities law at the University of Michigan. “He wanted to raise the profile of the agency,” says Pritchard, pointing to what he says is “an ambitious rulemaking agenda.” Let’s review some very recent history: Gensler’s time at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the agency that regulates derivatives markets. Gensler was in charge of the CFTC in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, during which he successfully convinced Congress to include, as part of the Dodd-Frank Act, new rules involving swaps (a type of financial derivative that was implicated in the crisis) that put them under the purview of the CFTC. His approach at that agency was described using words such as “hard-charging” and “aggressive.”  Before Dodd-Frank, the CFTC’s oversight was just the $35 trillion futures market; after, it was responsible for the $400 trillion swaps market as well. But taking on new duties also meant a lot of new work. The CFTC had to write a lot of new rules, and real people had to clock in hours to make that happen. On top of that, his enforcement chief filed “a record number of cases” against Wall Street banks. As a result of the speed and confusion with which the CFTC was working, the staff had to issue “130 exemptions or no-action letters,” essentially saying no enforcement action should be taken despite the existence of a new rule. He built up a reputation as a micromanager Under Gensler’s leadership, the CFTC outspent its budget and sometimes had to put employees on unpaid leave. At the same time, he built up a reputation as a micromanager. Gensler “routinely demanded that staff work weekends and holidays,” according to the Partnership for Public Service, which named the CFTC as one of the worst places in government to work while Gensler was at the helm.  Gensler’s management style left much to be desired; it also left the CFTC with a considerable amount of unoccupied real estate. Office space at the CFTC surged by almost 75 percent during his tenure. “Gensler signed leases across the country, assuming he would be able to fill the offices with new staff,” noted Fortune. But the funding for that staff never came, and by 2016, a fifth of the agency’s headquarters in DC remained unoccupied — as did almost a third of the New York office.  The playbook Gensler has been using at the SEC looks similar. Here, too, he’s been known for his hard-driving ethos. His two highest-profile issues, environmental disclosures and crypto, have earned him enemies in the Republican Party.  Under the SEC’s new rules around environmental disclosures, companies are required to disclose risks related to climate change. (Those rules have been paused in the face of an onslaught of lawsuits — part of a larger-scale attack on the regulatory state via the courts.)  “I don’t imagine a lot of voters are up in arms about public companies being forced to disclose the impact their policies have on the environment,” says Marc Fagel, who spent more than a decade at the SEC and who is now a lecturer at Stanford Law School. But because Republicans have been complaining about “ESG,” and “woke Wall Street,” this otherwise anodyne set of rules is now part of the culture wars.   But it’s Gensler’s record on crypto that makes his haters really froth at the mouth.  The division between the CFTC and the SEC is peculiar; in most other countries, there’s just one financial regulator. That division is a crucial part of the crypto story; the industry’s preferred regulator is the CFTC. But in the absence of a congressional mandate, a turf war has ensued, with the SEC filing enforcement actions against Coinbase and Binance, two of the largest exchanges, in 2023, claiming the exchanges allowed users to trade unregistered securities.  The SEC under both Gensler and his predecessor had some significant wins; it litigated or settled almost 200 crypto cases since 2017, Gensler told Barron’s in May. In March, a judge found that the suit against Coinbase could go forward — saying the SEC had sufficiently shown “that Coinbase operates as an exchange, as a broker, and as a clearing agency under the federal securities laws, and, through its Staking Program, engages in the unregistered offer and sale of securities.” Gensler has said outright that crypto is “rife with fraud, scams, bankruptcies and money laundering” Meanwhile, Gensler has said outright that crypto is “rife with fraud, scams, bankruptcies and money laundering” — not in and of itself a controversial opinion but one that maybe comes off a touch more outspoken than the typical federal bureaucrat. Maybe to drive the point home, he’s taken a number of crypto companies to task with enforcement actions, which include but are not limited to lawsuits. This is a sore point for the crypto industry, which has complained that the SEC isn’t making rules, just punishing companies, and doing so without providing clear guidance about how to avoid punishment. When the crypto exchange Coinbase requested that the SEC draft comprehensive rules for the crypto industry, the SEC rejected its petition. Coinbase then filed a legal challenge, saying the SEC’s denial was “arbitrary and capricious,” one of the legal standards for overturning an agency action.  Before I say more, let’s go over that again: one of the biggest crypto exchanges asked for more regulation, and then the regulatory agency in question — run by a man who says crypto is full of scams and frauds — said no. That seems pretty absurd on the face of it. Keep in mind, however, that there’s some weird legal crossfire in the timeline. Coinbase’s suit against the SEC over rulemaking was happening at the same time as the SEC’s suit against Coinbase over unregistered securities. And on top of that, there’s an additional complication: regulation just isn’t what it used to be. “The conservative judiciary has limited rulemaking,” says Fagel, the former SEC staffer. (The Supreme Court kneecapped regulators earlier this summer as part of an ongoing trend toward disempowering federal agencies.) “Yes, the SEC could spend three years concocting an entire regulatory regime for crypto. There would be a lawsuit in an hour.”  “Yes, the SEC could spend three years concocting an entire regulatory regime for crypto. There would be a lawsuit in an hour.” It might be more realistic to think of Coinbase’s suit as not asking for regulation per se, but as asking for regulation that Coinbase likes. Because if Coinbase doesn’t like said regulation, it’ll sue. Meanwhile, the courts have tended to back the SEC when it sues or takes enforcement actions — as opposed to rulemaking or other agency decision-making — so, rationally speaking, it’s just good sense for the SEC to focus on doing the things that judges let them do.  Gensler’s approach would be defensible, except that the SEC hasn’t abandoned rulemaking. In just the first eight months of 2022, the SEC proposed more than twice as many new rules as in 2021, and more than had been proposed annually for the last five years, according to an SEC inspector general report.  “There’s no question that the rulemaking initiatives have come fast and furious since he took over at the SEC,” says Pritchard. That means that the number of challenges to the rules has also spiked. Crafting rules that will withstand challenges is time-intensive, creating a feedback loop of more work for the staff, Pritchard says. This is the part that makes Gensler’s SEC start to look a lot like Gensler’s CFTC, and not in a good way. As a result of the pace of rulemaking, attrition rates at the SEC were the highest in 10 years, the 2022 inspector general report said. Managers told the SEC inspector general that it had been harder to hire people with experience, so the agency was relying on temporary workers, “in some cases with little or no experience in rulemaking.”  According to the SEC union, staff have been leaving “at more than twice the rate prior to Gensler’s arrival, and the pace of departures is continuing to accelerate.” The people who were most likely to leave were the most experienced. The SEC staff has experienced benefit cuts, which the union chalks up to “a series of budget decisions made by Chair Gensler,” who chose to increase spending, betting that Congress would increase the SEC’s budget. “In effect, Chair Gensler wagered with your compensation and benefits, knowing that his staff would suffer the consequences if he lost the bet,” the union told its membership. (Congress did not increase the SEC’s budget, and Gensler did in fact lose this bet.)  The union has also decried Gensler’s “irrational hostility” to remote work, adding that “the union is being forced to litigate issues like this more frequently under Chair Gensler than under any previous SEC Chairman.” Overwork and staff attrition have heavy consequences when you’re the literal government. In March 2024, SEC attorneys were sanctioned by a judge for “gross abuse of power” in a crypto case involving a company called Digital Licensing (or, more familiarly, Debt Box). Following the sanctions, the Salt Lake City offices of the SEC were closed because of “significant attrition” — and while the Debt Box fiasco wasn’t the only reason it closed, it did play a role. Attorney sanctions are relatively rare, and sanctions of government lawyers are even more so.  The SEC chair term lasts five years, meaning Gensler’s time is up in June 2026. But regardless of who is elected, Gensler’s tenure may not continue into the next administration. Gensler has said he would “absolutely” stay for a second term under Biden, when Biden was still the Democratic nominee. Meanwhile, the Trump campaign has targeted him specifically, with the former president saying he would “fire” Gensler. Vice President Kamala Harris’ donors have also been pushing to get rid of Gensler. Her exact stance on Gensler as a regulator isn’t clear, but Gensler is closely associated with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and the relationship between Warren and Harris has been tense. Legally, the president can fire SEC chairs — but the chair then becomes a normal SEC commissioner. In that case, they can only be removed for cause, says Anne Joseph O’Connell, a law professor at Stanford Law School. (Typically, though, chairs resign when a new party is elected, while the regular commissioners carry on.) It’s unclear what would happen in the case of a Harris administration — intraparty transitions don’t happen very often. Gensler is a symptom, not the disease It’s funny. There’s reason to think that Gensler is, in fact, bad at his job. But when the crypto industry calls for Gensler to get fired, it’s probably not because it’s concerned about the work-life balance of the SEC staff. The same people who want Gensler’s head on a platter are the least likely people in America to find common cause with the SEC union. And given the polarization in American politics, when Gensler is demonized by the crypto industry (and lumped in with the actually effective Lina Khan by the business class), he comes out looking good to a certain set of half-informed liberals. The real story here is the paralyzed regulatory state. The legislative chambers that could have increased the SEC’s budget and mitigated its problems of too much rulemaking with too little staff are gridlocked. (Maybe Gensler’s chaotic leadership would have rendered that a null effort, but it’s hard to say for sure.) As for the problems with what is sometimes termed “regulation by enforcement,” that’s exactly the incentive structure the right wing has set up by kneecapping agencies’ abilities to set rules. Gensler is a symptom, not the disease. When the SEC makes rules, it gets tied up in court, and so even when the industry wants rules, it’s not going to get them. Strong regulation isn’t nearly as dangerous for corporations as unpredictability is. Go ahead and fire Gensler — who cares? The next SEC chair isn’t going to be able to set predictable guidelines, either.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.",http://localhost:5000/images/image_3.jpg,C:\Users\compu\Documents\Civitas\flask-server\downloaded_images\image_3.jpg,Crypto
4,Crypto Trolls Hijacked NYC’s Dog Mayor Competition,Crypto holders have discovered a way to ruin the most fun and innocent of local competitions.,https://gizmodo.com/crypto-trolls-hijacked-nycs-dog-mayor-competition-2000524643,"The cryptocurrency industry can claim another magnanimous accomplishment to its name: transforming a wholesome New York City dog contest into little more than an online pump and dump scheme. The Honorary NYC Dog Mayor Election of 2024 was designed to be a fun, local competition between pooches. Dog-owners enter their pets into the contest, and then people online are allowed to vote on which is the most qualified to be dog mayor of New York (as far as I can tell, the qualifications begin and end with cuteness). Basically, its fantasy footballâbut with dogs. Unfortunately, the New York Times reported Wednesday that crypto bros had somehow caught wind of the competition and sunk their stupid, money-addled fangs into it. Indeed, it appears that one of the dogs, a Pomeranian named Bertram (or “Bertie,” as he’s better known), had a memecoin named after him. The working theory is that crypto holders then began promoting Bertram in the hopes that the price of the coin would rise, should he win. One of the owners, an influencer named Olivia Caputo, said that she began to notice that the contest was being irregularly skewed after seeing the vote tallies increase exponentially in a short period of time: Ms. Caputo said she first noticed something was awry in the quarterfinal matchup between Bertram and Ziggy the Yorkie mix. Bertramâs vote totalÂ increased sharply, to 4,000-plus votes, after receiving about 1,000 in the first round. That uptick coincided with people starting to push the dog hard on social media platforms and even posting offers of money for others to vote for him, Ms. Caputo said. She discovered a public chat on Telegram about the contest with thousands of messages a day, she said: âThey were using very hateful and violent language to Enzo. They said they would use the platform to âpump the price.ââ Caputo ultimately took her dogâa Shih Tzu named Enzoâout of the competition after it became apparent that the votes were being skewed. âI donât want my name attached to any pump-and-dump scheme,â she told the paper. âIt sucked out all the fun and cheapened the whole thing.â In the end, Bertram got the largest share of votes, but the competition operators were concerned that the result had been manipulated by the web3 goons. âI noticed spikes at certain times of the vote for Bertram,â said Stephen Calabria, the founder of the contest. âThere were certain things that just didnât seem right. Like blocs of 2,000 votes at once. It went from neck-and-neck to Bertram winning by 96 percent or something.â In the end, Bertram graciously stepped down from the contest, ceding victory to his opponent, a cattle dog named Simon. âFrankly, I had always envisioned this as a good faith and good humored way to get shelter dogs adopted and to use this as a platform for good,” Calabria told the Times. “If I never hear the word crypto again, it will be a blessing.â Unfortunately for Calabria, his wish is unlikely to come true.Â As we’ve previously noted, crypto backers just enjoyed a windfall of electoral victories. As a result, the prevalence of crypto in this country is likely to grow in the coming years, as is the industry’s grip over U.S. financial policy. Indeed, while the crypto industry suffered increased regulatory scrutiny during the Biden years, The Washington Post has reported that president elect Donald Trump is currently eyeing major crypto proponents for key financial regulator jobs. Many of the agencies tasked with overseeing the industryâmost notably, the Securities and Exchange Commissionâcould soon be staffed by bureaucrats who are in its back pocket. Meanwhile, Trump has promised to fire Gary Gensler, the current head of the SEC. Gensler came under fire by the crypto community for doing something that, as a federal regulator, he was not expected to do: his job. During his tenure, he looked into misbehaving crypto firms and sought to impose sane legal requirements on an otherwise unrestrained financial phenomenon that has stolen billions of dollars from the American public. Crypto trolls have blamed Gensler for being a draconian bureaucrat, but they really have only themselves to blame. Democrats were warming to the crypto industry until the FTX fiasco, which blew a hole in the industry’s credibility and forced regulators to take a harder line against web3’s obvious excesses and criminality. Today, Gensler released a statement suggesting he would soon be leaving the SEC. This is all a long way of saying that, contrary to Calabria’s wishes, we are all about to hear the word “crypto”âa lot. I wouldn’t be surprised if this is only the first of many dog mayor competitions that are hijacked by money-crazed web3 shitbags. Indeed, other recent headlines seem to portend a future dominated by untold “decentralized” stupidity:Â Elon Musk has named a new “government agency” after his favorite shitcoin; Caitlyn Jenner was just sued for her alleged role in a memecoin scam; Bitcoin’s value has spiked to a new all-time high; Pennsylvania wants to create its own “strategic reserve” of crypto. The normies have lost. Let the good times roll.

5,Guy Who Threw Away $500 Million Bitcoin Hard Drive Sues Local Government to Search Dump,What do you do when you've thrown half a billion dollars worth of crypto in the trash?,https://gizmodo.com/guy-who-threw-away-500-million-bitcoin-hard-drive-sues-local-government-to-search-dump-2000512846,"For the past decade, a Welsh man has been begging his city government for permission to peruse the contents of the local dump. 39-year-old Newport resident James Howells has been desperately asking to do this because, in 2013, he accidentally threw a hard drive containing 7,500 Bitcoin in the trash. Due to the cryptocurrency’s rise in value over the past ten years, those assets would be worth more than half a billion dollars today. Unfortunately for Howells, the Newport City Council has repeatedly declined his request. Legislators have argued that delving into the landfill’s depths would violate regulations and could prove hugely damaging to the surrounding environment. Now, in an effort to compel the local government to carry out his wishes, Howell has sued the council, asking for Â£495,314,800 in damages, Wales Online reports. The amount Howells is asking for is roughly the equivalent of what he would have made had he held onto the crypto-bearing drive. Howells told the local outlet that he doesn’t actually want that money from the council and is merely attempting to compel them to allow his excavation to go ahead. This is only the latest step in an increasingly desperate (and presumably quite costly) effort to recover the drive. The Register writes that, over the past ten years, Howells has “quit his job in IT and assembled a team of investors,” the likes of which will get to split the bulk of the assets, should the drive be found. Howells, meanwhile, plans to retain some 30 percent of its value. Bitcoin Dumpster Guy Has a Wild Plan to Rescue Millions in Crypto From a Landfill Gizmodo reached out to the Newport City Council for comment. We will update this story when we receive a response. Howells has claimed he will share a certain percentage of the profits from the hard drive with the local community, should he be able to retrieve it. In fact, Howell has made rather comical claims about the opportunity Newport’s legislators are missing out on by denying his request to scavenge the dump. “If they had spoken to me in 2013, this place would look like Las Vegas now,” Howell apparently told Wales Online. “Newport would look like Dubai. That’s the kind of opportunity they’ve missed.” It’s unclear whether the other local Newport denizensâwhose city is already considered a fairly bustling metropolitan communityâreally want the local environs to resemble Las Vegas. In a statement provided to The Register, the council said that it had “told Mr Howells multiple times that excavation is not possible under our environmental permit and that work of that nature would have a huge negative environmental impact on the surrounding area.” It added: “The council is the only body authorized to carry out operations on the site.” It’s worth considering how much money Howells has been sinking into this quixotic pursuit. After all, the drive in question could very well be A) lost forever and/or B) thoroughly corrupted and unusable. If that’s the case, Howell has effectively wasted years of his life and a huge chunk of change on nothing. At the same time, were Howells to somehow get his mitts on his beloved drive, and were his crypto assets to somehow be in a retrievable format, he would never have to work againâso you can sorta understand his zeal for this whole thing.

6,Crypto CEO Kidnapped and Held for $1 Million Ransom,The CBC reported that WonderFi CEO Dean Skurka was held for a short time before paying a $1 million ransom.,https://gizmodo.com/crypto-ceo-kidnapped-and-held-for-1-million-ransom-2000521923,"The CEO of a Canadian cryptocurrency company was kidnapped and held for ransom for a short period on Wednesday, Canadian media reported. Around 6 p.m., Toronto police received a report of a kidnapping around University Avenue and Richmond Street in Toronto. The CBC identified the victim as Dean Skurka, CEO of WonderFi, a publicly traded crypto platform that claims to oversee more than $1.35 billion in assets. The CBC said that Skurka was forced into a vehicle and paid a $1 million ransom to secure his release. He was eventually found in Centennial Park in Toronto, He told the outlet in an email that “Client funds and data remain safe, and were not impacted by this incident.” As of Thursday, Toronto police had not released any public information about the incident. Neither Skurka nor WonderFi posted any statements on the incident. Cryptocurrency founders, investors, and the people close to them have been targeted scores of times in recent years by thieves and kidnappers. In September, Nick Drakon, the then-CEO of crypto research firm Revelo Intel resigned from his job after disclosing that he was robbed by a group of attackers who stole his personal funds as well as assets from his businesses. Earlier this year, the FBI and local police arrested a dozen men involved in a home invasion spree that targeted crypto holders.

7,Creator of Crypto Mixer ‘Bitcoin Fog’ Gets 12 1/2 Years In Prison,"Roman Sterlingov testified at trial that he never operated Bitcoin Fog, which allowed users to obfuscate the origins of their crypto.",https://gizmodo.com/creator-of-crypto-mixer-bitcoin-fog-gets-12-1-2-years-in-prison-2000522542,"The founder of cryptocurrency mixing service Bitcoin Fog was sentenced on Friday to 150 months in prison for operating what prosecutors described as one of the “largest and longest-running money laundering services.” According to prosecutors, the service was used to launder over $400 million in criminal proceeds since being created in 2011. The case was one that challenged the idea that cryptocurrencies, because they are not fiat currency, can operate outside of normal legal frameworks. As blockchain analysis and crypto payment tracing techniques have matured and become central to criminal investigations, it was a matter of time before the services key to scrambling the origins of money would come under scrutiny themselves. Besides money laundering, mixers can be charged with running unlicensed money transmitting businesses. Basically, allowing people to send and receive money without checking their identities. In layman’s terms, cryptocurrency mixers are big pools where crypto users deposit their tokens, after which the cryptocurrency gets shuffled, then redistributed back to users equal to the original amount they put in, minus a service fee taken by the mixer. The idea is to prevent forensic accountants from following that money’s trail, though proponents of the services say they just help individuals maintain their privacy. As part of sentencing, Sterlingov, 36, was ordered to forfeit his interest in a Bitcoin Fog wallet with containing Bitcoin valued at more than $103 million. Sterlingov has said that his crypto holdings came not from Bitcoin Fog but from early investment in cryptocurrencies. He did concede that he used the service as a user seeking privacy, and suggested those transactions led prosecutors to wrongly tie him to the service’s operations. Sterlingov maintained throughout trial that he never operated Bitcoin Fog. After sentencing, however, Sterlingov expressed remorse. âI am sorry for any harm that may have come from my actions,â he told the judge. âIâm fully committed to becoming a better person.â The government tied Sterlingov to the service by showing a trail of financial transactions from 2011 linking him to payments made to register the Bitcoinfog.com domain. Bitcoin Fog operated on the dark web, but Bitcoinfog.com advertised how to find the site. Sterlingov said in court that he worked in 2011 as a web designer for a Swedish marketing company, implying he might have made the site for a client. But he also said he couldn’t remember for sure as it was so long ago. WIRED back in 2022 explained more of the government’s evidence: The funds to pay for that domain traveled through several accounts and were eventually exchanged from Bitcoin for the now-defunct digital currency Liberty Reserve, according to prosecutors. But the IRS says IP addresses, blockchain data, and phone numbers linked with the various accounts all connect the payments to Sterlingov. A Russian-language document in Sterlingovâs Google Account also described a method for obfuscating payments similar to the one heâs accused of using for that domain registration. Prosecutors concluded, and the jury agreed, that despite a lack of service logs or other evidence linking Sterlingov to the operations of Bitcoin Fog, the overwhelming evidence supported it beyond a reasonable doubt. The defendantâs statements canât âbe reconciled with the juryâs verdict,â prosecutors wrote in their sentencing memo. The co-founder of another crypto mixer, Tornado Cash, was sentenced in May to 64 months in prison after being found guilty by a Dutch court of laundering over $1.2 billion. Who knows, if President-elect Trump follows through on his pledge to commute Ross Ulbricht’s life sentence for operating the Silk Road dark marketplace, maybe Sterlingov and other crypto mixers might have a similar chance at freedom. It seems unlikely the pledge was anything more than a ploy to win support, however.

8,The Worst People in the World Are Making a Ton of Money After Trump’s Victory,"Private prisons, crypto, banks, and the stock-market in general are all soaring at the news of Trump’s return to the White House.",https://gizmodo.com/the-worst-people-in-the-world-are-making-a-ton-of-money-after-trumps-victory-2000521095,"Donald Trump has won the presidency and businesses connected with him and his allies are soaring. According to early financial reports, winners include banks, crypto-related stocks, and private prison companies. All of the worst people in the financial game. Trump Media & Technology Groupâs plummeted in the early hours of the election on Tuesday as people waited to see who would be elected president. It was up on Monday but crashed so hard during the election that trading of the stock was briefly halted. On November 3, it hit a low of $32.80 a share. On Wednesday, however, as markets woke up to the news that Trump would return to the White House, DJT soared. It jumped 10% in after-hours trading on Tuesday night as the early returns from the election favored Trump. Itâs up just under 8% so far today, trading at around $42 a share as of this writing. Crypto stocks also won big following Trumpâs election. Bitcoin hit a new all-time high of $73,737, a surge of almost 10%. Ether, Solana, and other cryptocurrencies followed suit. Trump, led by his son Barron, is a very crypto-friendly president. His campaign raised millions in crypto donations. On the campaign trail, Trump promised to make America the âcrypto capital of the planet.â Elon Musk is also reaping the early rewards of Trump’s victory. Tesla stocks have gained ground all morning and are up 15% as of this writing. Musk went all in on Trump after an attempt on the president-electâs life over the Summer. He bet big on Trump winning. It appears the bet is already starting to pay off. In addition to a surging stock price, Musk is also expected to have a seat at the White House table. Musk has teased heâll be responsible for slashing government spending, but the details arenât yet clear. Private prisons also saw a huge bump in stock prices. GEO Group is up a shocking 26% this morning and CoreCivicâonce known as Corrections Corporation of Americaâis up 20%. Why? One of Trumpâs big campaign promises was the mass deportation of undocumented immigrants. That kind of program will require a lot of infrastructure. Camps, if you will, in which to concentrate large groups of people. Itâs a good bet that private prisons are poised to make a lot of money off the project. Overall, the stock market loves the Trump victory. The dollar, yields on U.S. Treasury bonds, and the S&P 500 are all up. How long that will last is anyone’s guess. Even Elon Musk has insisted Trump’s policies will tank the U.S. economy.

9,"Ubisoft Finally Launches Its NFT Game, Hoping to Capitalize on the Crypto Grift","NFTs for Ubisoft’s Champions Tactics: Grimoria Chronicles cost between $7 and close to $64,000.",https://gizmodo.com/ubisoft-finally-launches-its-nft-game-hoping-to-capitalize-on-the-crypto-grift-2000518439,"Ubisoft hasn’t yet left its hopes for the inevitable NFT comeback at the door like many other major publishers have these last few years. The publisher’s long-awaited figurine battler Champions Tactics Grimoria Chronicles went live last week, and already the game is asking those with deep pockets to drop hundreds or even thousands on digital figurines to battle with players online. The NFTs you can buy with in-game currency or crypto are selling for between $55 and an incredible $63,863. Ubisoft first announced Grimoria Chronicles last year, and the game went through a closed beta over the summer of 2024. Though the game technically launched on Oct. 23, Ubisoft made no peep about the game on any of its main social media accounts (although the developer has been promoting it on its own Twitter), and you won’t find it featured on its website alongside major releases like Star Wars: Outlaws and Assassins Creed Shadows. The game is a turn-based battler where players have the chance to mint NFTs of figurines, all with a standard slate of stats and classic roles like “Tank” or “Damage.” You set up to three figures against an opponent’s slate. Then, each of you performs the classic dance of kicking each other’s shins until one of you falls down. Your figures gain experience and loot for every battle, and then you rinse and repeat. It’s like a rudimentary, PVP version of Darkest Dungeon, but with more nickel and diming. Users are granted a few starter figures, but the game incentivizes you to buy, buy, buy. Want new figures? You’ll need to buy them off other players or “Forge” them, which also costs crypto. In every way, this is yet another web3 game in the vein of the now-maligned “play to earn” game Axie Infinity. It’s running on the Oasys blockchain. Worse still, you need to sign into a Ubisoft account to access the game at all. As evidenced by live gameplay, there are critical hits and other RNGs for damage. Still, Ubisoft claims on its webpage the game isn’t based on luck but skill. You need to “pick the best champions to counter your opponent’s lineup” and “master the ever-changing meta.” However, the game’s NFT marketplace is absolutely subsumed with cheap figures with low stats and few abilities. The difference between a $7 and a $150 champion can be between a few points in stats like “Vitality” or a higher initiative. By that token, the fabled $64,000 “Swift Zealot” figure doesn’t seem anywhere near worth the money, even if all you cared about in this world was winning more matches in the game’s dull-looking, back-and-forth battles. In a statement, Ubisoft Paris studio director Francois Bodson told IGN that it worked with Ubisoft’s Strategic Innovation lab to ensure the blockchain “was done in service of delivering new and innovative gaming experiences for our players.” He related his game to a “physical trading card game” and said the team plans to keep up work on the title after launch. Each figure is procedurally generated from a host of pre-made assets, which guarantees none are truly that unique or have any real personality. It feels like a cash grab meant to incentivize players to grind long hours in anonymity or buy in for hundreds or thousands of dollars in the vain hope of cashing out later. It’s a sick, twisted vision of gaming that players have long since rejected. Ubisoft is the only studio that hasn’t got the memo on that front. Last year, Sega’s co-COO Shuji Utsumi said the company was no longer totally sold on the whole NFT thing. Meanwhile, Mojang and Valve have summarily rejected crypto. The few remaining crypto games that are still in development include Ready Player One’s author Ernest Cline and his “metaverse” title, which is based on his geek-culture obsessed universe. Ubisoft has been on the NFT train for the past three years, but it hasn’t met with much success on that front. The publisher was widely condemned for attempting to shove NFTs into Ghost Recon: Breakpoint in 2021. Ubisoft’s plan to sell numbered helmets, pants, and guns reportedly netted the company just a few hundred dollars through its Quartz platform. Ubisoft halted its plans for more Quartz items in Wildlands and Ghost Recon: Breakpoint in 2022. Ubisoft is trying to have its cake and eat it, too. It hopes nobody notices the new crypto game, knowing how the gaming community has largely rejected digital currency. It’s hoping that crypto might make a comeback or that enough people will buy-in on the backend. Crypto in gaming is nothing more than a more effective monetization scheme than microtransactions. Ubisoft’s head of subscriptions, Philippe Tremblay, said earlier this year players would eventually get “comfortable” not owning their games. If anything is clear, buying a “one of a kind” digital figurine doesn’t supply you with any more ownership than before.

12,Elon Musk Is Trying to Be the MrBeast of Politics,The billionaire is giving away $1 million a day to registered voters. The lottery is the next evolution of politics as entertainment in America.,https://gizmodo.com/elon-musk-is-trying-to-be-the-mrbeast-of-politics-2000514361,"When I imagine the future of American politics I see Elon Musk’s grinning face as he gives away a million bucks on stage before a crowd of clapping people. Musk is approaching politics the way a YouTuber like MrBeast approaches audience engagement. Both men are giving away huge cash prizes to get people to tune in, and they’re ignoring the legality and consequences of their actions. Over the weekend, Musk handed out oversized novelty $1 million checks to two voters in Pennsylvania. During a ceremony filmed and broadcast on X, the billionaire gave away the cash to voters who signed a petition he’s peddling in support of the constitution. John Dreher, the first million-dollar winner, is a self-professed huge Musk fan. “Actually meeting Elon, I kind of forgot about the money for a little bit,” Dreher said in a video on X. “He’s such an influential figure for guys my age who are working hard every day.” “When he came on stage it was so exciting,” Kristine Fishell, the second million-dollar winner, said in her own video on X. “He did the jump like he did at the Butler rally, it was just really fun to see.” The videos are striking because they feel more like entertainment than politics. In America, the two have long gone hand in hand, but Musk giving away cash prizes to registered voters and making them sit down to film testimonials afterward feels like a generational shift. These are the kinds of videos that would fit well on the feed of a YouTuber like MrBeast who gives away huge cash prizes for people who compete in games where they suffer and humiliate themselves. These two Pennsylvania residents received $1 million each from Elon Musk for signing a petition in support of the First and Second Amendments! 🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/eef2a8C9ht — DogeDesigner (@cb_doge) October 20, 2024  Musk has been heavily involved in the U.S. presidential election since the attempted assassination of Trump in July. He started a pro-Trump super PAC and injected $75 million of his own cash, repeatedly posted his support for Trump online, and appeared with the candidate at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. But the billionaire’s latest scheme may violate campaign finance law. He’s giving one lucky voter in a swing state who signs his petition $1 million per day, every day, until the election. What’s the petition? It’s simple. “The First and Second Amendments guarantee freedom of speech and the right to bear arms. By signing below, I am pledging my support for the First and Second Amendments,” it says. Any registered voter who signs on the dotted line gets $47 bucks and is entered for a chance to win the $1 million. The cash is only available to some voters. “This program is exclusively open to registered voters in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Nevada, Arizona, Michigan, Wisconsin, and North Carolina. Expires October 21,” the petition says. If you’re wondering if this is legal, you’re not alone. On Sunday, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro called out Musk’s scheme on Meet the Press. “Musk obviously has a right to be able to express his views. He’s made it very, very clear that he supports Donald Trump. I don’t. Obviously we have a difference of opinion,” Shapiro said. “I don’t deny him that, right, but when you start flowing this kind of money into politics, I think it raises serious questions.” Rick Hansen, a legal scholar at the UCLA School of Law, called out Musk’s giveaway on his Election Law Blog. Hansen’s view? “This one is clearly illegal,” Hansen said of the $1 million giveaway. Hansen pointed to section 52 U.S.C. 10307(c) of U.S. election law and page 44 of the Justice Department’s Election Crimes Manual. “For an offer or a payment to violate Section 10307(c), it must have been intended to induce or reward the voter for engaging in one or more acts necessary to cast a ballot,” the manual said. The matter isn’t clear-cut. The money and prizes are for signing a petition, but the petition is thinly veiled and covered in language about registered voters. In their videos, both Fishell and Dreher emphasized the importance of voting and voting early. It’s clear to anyone watching that the cash prizes aren’t just rewards for the petition, but monetary incentives to get out the vote. What will come of this? Will Musk be prosecuted? I think that will largely depend on the outcome of the Presidential election. But one thing I know for sure: the future of American politics will have more MrBeast-style stunts.

13,The Untold Story of Trump's Failed Attempt to Overthrow Venezuela's President,"A successful CIA hack of Venezuela's military payroll system, insider fights for spy agency resources, and messy opposition politics: A WIRED investigation reveals a secret Trump-era attempt to oust autocratic ruler Nicolás Maduro.",https://www.wired.com/story/trump-cia-venezuela-maduro-regime-change-plot/,"On September 26, 2018, Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro approached the lectern at the United Nations General Assembly in New York City. Hulking and mustachioed, wearing a black suit and a bright red tie, Maduro was in a bilious mood. At home, Maduro’s political position was deteriorating. The former bus driver turned autocrat had ruled Venezuela for five years, and had recently “won” reelection in a contest widely considered to be fraudulent. But he was facing stiffer-than-expected pushback. Anti-government protests were wracking the oil-rich South American nation. Hyperinflation was obliterating its economy. More than a million Venezuelans had fled, triggering a hemispheric refugee crisis. For some time, the Trump administration had been working furiously to push Maduro—an ally of Cuba and Russia—out of power. In fact, then-president Donald Trump had even mused publicly about exercising “a possible military option, if necessary,” to deal with Venezuela. The day before Maduro’s General Assembly address, Trump stood at the same UN podium, called the situation in Venezuela a “human tragedy,” and decried the “suffering, corruption, and decay” wrought by communist and socialist regimes. The US president then announced the imposition of new sanctions against members of Maduro’s inner circle. When Maduro began his UN address, he was raring to punch back. His country was the “victim of a permanent aggression” by the “imperial” United States, he said. Venezuela’s attempt at geopolitical independence—and huge gold and petroleum reserves—had aroused the ire and avarice of the “oligarchies of the continent and those who dominate from Washington,” he added. Maduro’s harangue got darker. He claimed that a recent attempt on his life—two drones had exploded during an address he was giving outdoors in Caracas—had been masterminded by shadowy actors from within the United States. (Trump administration officials publicly denied any role in the drone attack and a dissident member of the Venezuelan army later claimed responsibility.) In recent days, Maduro had even said he was considering skipping the UN meeting altogether, because he was worried about an assassination attempt. As bitter adversaries, the Trump administration and Maduro regime didn’t agree on, well, anything. Except for the fact that the US government wanted Maduro gone. After that UN meeting, the Trump administration amped up its efforts around the world to isolate and depose the Venezuelan leader, including by levying additional punishing sanctions against his regime. Much of that diplomatic maneuvering played out in public. But the administration also put into motion another, very much secret prong to the US’s regime-change campaign: a covert CIA-run initiative to help overthrow the Venezuelan strongman. That campaign would pull off at least one disruptive digital sabotage operation against the Maduro regime in 2019. But the CIA-led initiative—alongside the Trump administration’s wider efforts to get rid of Maduro—would fall well short of its ultimate goal. The story of that secret anti-Maduro effort also lays bare the tensions between an administration with hardliners laser-focused on deposing the Venezuelan autocrat and a CIA deeply reluctant, yet nevertheless obligated, to follow White House orders. It shows the limitations of covert, CIA-assisted regime change schemes, particularly when they are not aligned with larger US foreign policy objectives. And it provides new insights into how a second Trump administration—or a Harris presidency—might still try to dislodge the Venezuelan strongman, whose latest sham reelection in July 2024 has again thrust his country into chaos. The details of that covert CIA-assisted campaign, told exclusively to WIRED by eight Trump administration and former agency officials with knowledge of the anti-Maduro operation, are reported here for the first time. On January 23, 2019, Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó stood before throngs of cheering protestors at a rally in Caracas. With his right hand held aloft, he declared himself interim president of Venezuela, with the full backing from the National Assembly, the country’s highest legislative body. That day, Guaidó vowed to “reestablish the constitution”—which many believed Maduro, whose second term had begun earlier that month, had repeatedly trampled. Guaidó’s rise in 2019 helped cement US national security advisor John Bolton’s conviction that “it was time to turn the screws” on Maduro, according to Bolton’s memoir. “The revolution was on,” writes Bolton. After Guaidó’s speech, the administration recognized him as Venezuela’s rightful acting leader, and went to work lobbying other countries to do the same. (Around 60 countries would ultimately recognize Guaidó.) In late January, the Trump administration also announced its harshest Venezuela-related sanctions to date, targeting the country’s state-owned oil company and freezing billions of dollars in Venezuelan state assets. Around that time, the administration turned to the CIA to seek the agency’s help in ousting Maduro, according to former US officials familiar with the secret program. (Sources requested anonymity to discuss sensitive White House deliberations and CIA operations. The CIA declined to comment.) The CIA quickly assembled a Venezuela Task Force. That group had its work cut out for it. Before the Trump administration’s directive, Venezuela was a low priority at Langley, and capabilities had to be built from the ground up, according to the administration and former CIA officials. One of the task force’s first goals: an expansion of efforts to hack Venezuelan government networks and other infrastructure targets for intelligence-gathering purposes. Very quickly, the task force ran into roadblocks. It had to fight—sometimes unsuccessfully—for access to important resources, like elite CIA and NSA hacking teams. Those teams usually worked on higher-profile targets, according to a former agency official. In fact, when officials in the administration asked to have NSA hacking resources redirected to Venezuela, a former Trump-era official said top Pentagon officials “pushed back hard.” Ultimately, the CIA successfully carried out a disruptive strike against Maduro: a cyberattack on the state-administered payroll system used to compensate members of Venezuela’s military, according to four Trump administration and former CIA officials. The gambit, which took months for the agency to even attempt thanks to the internal struggle for resources, had been designed to push teetering Venezuelan military officials to the Guaidó camp. Former officials differ slightly in their descriptions of the payroll-related operation. Some characterize it as a remote-access cyberattack; others, as a digital sabotage operation enabled by agents on the ground. Regardless of how the cyberattack was carried out, the result was unhappy soldiers—and a risk to Maduro’s grip on power. Temporarily denying Venezuelan soldiers from receiving their paychecks was part of the administration’s goal to “exacerbate, or just further reveal, the ineptitudes of the regime,” a former national security official says. And it had some effect, says a former senior official: “There was a fair amount of grumbling about not getting paid,” the official says. “Armies march on their stomach.” The secret CIA-led campaign had other prongs too. The agency launched a covert influence campaign to spread pro-democracy content online in Venezuela, spun up a “democracy promotion” program to secretly sponsor leadership trainings, and provided support to Venezuelan civic groups, according to former US officials. But as these efforts got under way, more cracks between the administration and the CIA started to show. Trump administration officials were unimpressed by the agency’s “democracy promotion” efforts. The CIA’s secret program appeared to be indistinguishable from pro-democracy initiatives carried out openly by other government agencies like USAID, according to four former officials. It was “the most embarrassing bullshit ever,” says a former national security official—“not even sinister,” but “purely lazy.” To some Trump administration officials, the presence in Venezuela of a viable, legitimate opposition leader like Guaidó, and the ongoing humanitarian catastrophe in the country, made the CIA’s covert “pro-democracy” campaign appear farcical. “The average person has lost 25 pounds,” a former official says. “They have no food, they have no electricity, they have no jobs, they have no medicine. And we're going to tell them about democracy?” All this led some administration officials to believe that the CIA was focusing on the democracy-promotion efforts to wriggle out of conducting more hard-edged covert operations. It “was their excuse for not doing other things,” says a former US official. “I felt like they were playing with us.” “The CIA is not the Mossad. It's hunkered down, bureaucratic, and not daring … I'd like to see an intelligence community that's more capable of carrying out clandestine operations in support of American policy,” Bolton tells WIRED. (Bolton declined to comment on any specific agency activities or discussions within the Trump administration about Venezuela-related covert operations.) To some Trump-era officials, CIA executives—including CIA director Gina Haspel—were clearly opposed to the administration’s directive. Haspel “never bought into doing anything aggressive in Venezuela because she was still of the mind that we were ugly Americans,” says a senior Trump-era official. Haspel declined to comment. ""Part of the intelligence community is still traumatized by the Bay of Pigs invasion and failure. That's number one,” Bolton says. “Number two, other parts of it are still traumatized by the Obama administration view that we have no enemies in Latin America. Castro regime's OK. Chavez-Maduro regime's OK. They're not really threats. Ortega and Nicaragua was not really a threat. That wasn't my view."" Still, administration officials continued to push the CIA and Pentagon to take combative actions. Like one that involved Cuba. Cuba relies on oil from Venezuela. In return, US officials believe, the Cuban security services have helped protect Maduro, essentially serving as an on-the-ground praetorian guard for the embattled socialist autocrat. The Trump administration thought if the US could somehow intercept or sabotage the oil ships sailing from Venezuela to Cuba, it could strike a blow against both regimes. Senior administration officials held meetings with paramilitary experts to look at the mechanics of such an operation. At least one option involved the CIA, which had a mobile system that could covertly (and nonviolently) disable ships. Trump administration officials wanted the agency to move the system near Venezuela, to hit some of its fuel tankers. The agency balked. CIA officials explained that it only had one of these systems, that it was currently in another hemisphere, and they didn’t want to move it to the northern end of South America. The idea was shelved. That wasn’t the end of it. Some administration officials lobbied for US special operators to conduct sabotage operations within Venezuela. But US intelligence and Pentagon officials were deeply opposed to having any American boots on the ground in the country. Those options were taken off the table too. At least once, Colombia stepped into the breach. The Colombians have a long history of working with CIA and Pentagon paramilitaries. Now they agreed to launch an operation inside Venezuela to disable some of the Venezuelan air force’s prized Russian-made Sukhoi fighter jets. The US provided targeting intelligence. But when the Colombian operatives carried out the sabotage, says a former senior official, the gambit was not as successful as initially hoped. The operatives were able to disable just a few of the aircraft. As the days went by, hawks like Bolton tried to keep Trump focused on ousting Maduro. The national security advisor wrote in his memoir that, in a late January 2019 phone call with the opposition leader, Trump had assured Guaidó he’d “pull off Maduro’s overthrow.” On that call Trump had also, Bolton writes, alluded to the US’s interest in Venezuela’s oil. But as various efforts plodded along, the president’s confidence in Guaidó’s team started to waver. Trump just wasn’t sure Guaidó was up for the job. In contrast to the “strong” Maduro, Trump thought Guaidó was “weak,” writes Bolton. The president began to refer to Guaidó as the “Beto O’Rourke of Venezuela.” In early March of that year, according to the memoir, Trump told Bolton, “He doesn’t have what it takes.” Bolton and his allies didn’t let up. They even developed “day after” plans for Guaidó’s ascension. A pilot program spearheaded by the US Treasury Department, known as “Venezuela Day One,” was to involve the mass distribution of preloaded debit cards, from the Spanish banking powerhouse Banco Santander, which worked closely with the administration on the initiative. The idea was to give a financial lifeline to needy Venezuelans in the immediate post-Maduro era. That plan, along with other “day after” initiatives, ended up shelved. Banco Santander declined WIRED’s request to comment. Meanwhile, fractures within the administration deepened. Even by the hawkish standards of the Trump administration, the Bolton camp’s Venezuela strategy was considered aggressive. At one point, officials created a working group focused on Venezuela. It included the CIA and the State, Treasury, and Defense departments. One group it—intentionally—did not include: Bolton and his allies on the National Security Council, says a former State Department official. The CIA “sort of thought they were dealing with Oliver North,” another official says, adding that the spy agency “reacted in an equal and opposite direction” to what they felt was Bolton’s aggressiveness by trying to avoid any operations that could cause blowback for the CIA. Schisms even opened between administration hawks. By March 2019, the security situation in Venezuela was spiraling ever-downward. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo decided to shut down the US embassy in Caracas that same month. Some administration officials believed Pompeo was primarily worried about the political fallout of presiding over “another Benghazi”—the 2012 attack by Islamist militants on US government facilities in Libya that killed four Americans, including the ambassador. “Pompeo made part of his career criticizing the Obama administration on the failures in Benghazi,” Bolton says. “And I do think that was kind of etched in his mind."" Pompeo did not respond to requests for comment. Yet other former officials emphasized the existence of specific, credible threats of violence by the Maduro regime to embassy personnel, including to the top US diplomat in the country. (“It definitely was not a sort of middle-of-the-night Pompeo panic,” says a former State Department official. “There were direct threats that had been made.”) Whatever Pompeo’s motivations, the closure of the embassy would have major implications for US intelligence-gathering in Venezuela—and for the larger US-backed push to oust Maduro, say some former officials. It was a “disaster,” one former US official says. The US still had ways to spy on Venezuelan targets remotely. But before the embassy closure, officials in Washington would talk to important Venezuelans, taking the political temperature and coordinating potential defections from the Maduro camp; then CIA and State Department officials on the ground in the country would confirm details with these people in person. By shutting down the embassy, say Trump-era officials, US efforts to oust Maduro were dealt a big blow. “It all got screwed up in the stupidest way,” a former national security official says. Of course, much in Venezuela was outside the control of officials in Washington. The opposition was working with sympathetic regime members to lobby members of Venezuela’s high court to rule Maduro’s reelection illegitimate. It was also negotiating with powerful regime members, including Maduro’s own defense minister, to cut Maduro loose. But the opposition made some big missteps. After a bunch of delays, Guaidó’s plan to overthrow Maduro was—finally—to come together on April 30, 2019. That day, Guaidó publicly announced “Operation Liberty,” exhorting military members to defect and calling for massive street protests. Trump administration officials believed that Maduro was close to abdicating the presidency, maybe even fleeing to Cuba. Then it all fell apart. There was a lot of miscommunication and mistrust between critical players in the opposition and Maduro’s equivocating supporters. At the last minute, major Venezuelan officials backed off the ledge. Mass military desertions failed to materialize. The Venezuelan high court chickened out. The protests were a flop. Maduro, bolstered by Cuban security forces at his side, rallied his supporters. The momentum had shifted against regime change. Though the Venezuelan opposition—and the Trump administration—would limp along in their attempts to oust Maduro, the best chance had been lost. Trump administration officials found themselves “spinning the[ir] wheels for months,” says a former national security official. If the CIA had intervened more forcefully between January and April—when schisms within the military and among other Venezuelan elites were the biggest and Guaidó had the most momentum—it might have helped catalyze Maduro’s ouster, say former officials. But the agency didn’t. “As [former secretary of defense Donald] Rumsfeld once said, you go to war with the army you have,” Bolton says. “And we had a lack of capability in a number of agencies, including the intelligence community. We couldn't wait around for them to happen. So we had to do the best we could."" “There was a handful of sabotage and cyber stuff that was done,” says a former national security official. “But it was too little, too late.” Even the one major CIA action—the digital sabotage operation that disabled the Venezuelan military payroll system—happened after the opposition began to lose momentum in 2019, according to the former official. After the payroll sabotage operation, the Venezuela Task Force began to wither. “It was kind of a one trick pony,” says a former senior agency official. CIA officials were “doing this 16 hours a day for four weeks. And then it's over—nobody gives a shit anymore,” says another former agency official. This sort of frenzied, time-compressed approach to covert action was highly unusual, this person adds. “Trump never made it enough of a priority for the rest of the national security components of the government to step up” and help overthrow the Venezuelan leader, says a former senior administration official. “Haspel,” the source says, “was absolutely not inclined to lean forward unless someone brought her into the Oval Office and said, ‘You know, you have to do this.’ And it never reached that point.” What’s more, in September 2019, Trump pushed out Bolton, the most steadfast driver of the administration’s Venezuela-related efforts. When the presidency changed hands, the Biden administration tried a different approach. In October 2023, worried about rising gasoline prices and a spiraling refugee crisis—and looking to cleave Venezuela from Russia, China, and Iran’s orbit— administration officials brokered a deal with Maduro. For agreeing to allow free and fair presidential elections in July 2024 and accepting Venezuelan refugees deported by the US, the US would ease some of the tough Trump-era sanctions on the nation’s energy sector. Maduro quickly reneged on the deal. His administration disqualified and barred leading opposition candidates from running for president, and kicked off a broad anti-democratic crackdown. Six months later, the Biden administration reimposed oil sanctions against the regime. This past July, Maduro declared victory in a vote once again marred by widespread fraud. Mass protests spread throughout Venezuela. Thousands of civilians were arrested. In August, US secretary of state Antony Blinken said there was “overwhelming evidence” that opposition candidate Edmundo González Urrutia had won the election. In September, fearing arrest or assassination, González fled to Spain. (In a recent interview, Trump called Maduro a “dictator,” but also seemed to praise the regime for what it claimed to be successful efforts to lower crime in Caracas, calling it “safer than many of our cities.”) At the moment, the authoritarian Maduro’s grip on power seems secure. But there might be a “silver lining” to all the Venezuela-focused intelligence activity prompted by the Trump administration’s anti-Maduro campaign, a former CIA official says. Before that, US spy agencies had never devoted much energy to sophisticated cyberespionage or signals intelligence collection targeting Venezuela, according to the former official. But now, this source says, US intelligence agencies have “a lot better access” to Venezuela-related intelligence. “There could be some benefit down the line.” Image Source: Getty Images",http://localhost:5000/images/image_13.jpg,C:\Users\compu\Documents\Civitas\flask-server\downloaded_images\image_13.jpg,Politics
14,Amsterdam violence exposes tensions in Dutch society: 'We cannot be made into enemies',There are concerns the unrest has damaged community relations and tensions have spilled over into politics too.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c30p1jmzjrzo,"A fragile calm hangs over the Dutch capital, still reeling from the unrest that erupted a week ago when Israeli football fans came under attack in the centre of Amsterdam. City officials described the violence as a ""toxic combination of antisemitism, hooliganism, and anger” over the war in Gaza, Israel and elsewhere in the Middle East. As the streets are cleared of Maccabi Ultras stickers and tensions linger, there is concern about the damage done to relations between Amsterdam’s Jewish and Muslim communities. The tensions have spilled over into Dutch politics too. The Netherlands' coalition government has been left hanging by a thread after a Moroccan-born junior minister resigned because of language used by coalition colleagues. Amsterdam had already seen protests and tensions because of the war in the Middle East, and local Rabbi Lody van de Kamp believes it was like a tinderbox: ""If you put 2,000 [Israeli] football supporters on to the streets, you know you are in trouble.” Maccabi Tel Aviv fans had arrived in the city for a Europa League match against Ajax and footage was widely shared the night before showing a group of fans climbing up a wall to tear down and burn a Palestinian flag.  An Amsterdam council report said taxis were also attacked and vandalised. Emine Uğur, a well-known columnist in the Muslim community, says underlying tensions surrounding the war in Gaza meant that the ensuing violence was ""a long time coming"".  She speaks of a lack of acknowledgement of the pain felt by communities affected by a conflict that had left many without an outlet for their grief and frustration. The flag-burning incident as well as anti-Arab chants were seen as a deliberate provocation.  But then messages calling for retaliation appeared on social media, some using chilling terms such as ""Jew hunt"". On the evening of the match, a pro-Palestinian protest was moved away from the Johan Cruyff arena, but it was in the hours afterwards that the violence erupted. The 12-page report by Amsterdam’s authorities describes some Maccabi supporters “committing acts of vandalism” in the centre.  Then it highlights “small groups of rioters… engaged in violent hit-and-run actions targeting Israeli supporters and nightlife crowd” in locations across the city centre. They moved “on foot, by scooter, or car… committing severe assaults”. The mayor of Amsterdam, Femke Halsema, described the incidents as deeply alarming, and noted for some they were a reminder of historical pogroms against Jews. For a few hours, swathes of the Jewish community in a European capital felt as though they were under siege. These events coincided with the anniversary of the Nazi pogroms on Jews in 1938, also known as Kristallnacht.  That only intensified the fears of Amsterdam's Jewish community, although local imams and other members of the Muslim community took part in the commemorations. Senior members, including Esther Voet, editor of the Dutch Jewish Weekly, organised emergency shelters and coordinated rescue efforts for those fearing for their lives. The Dutch government has responded by allocating €4.5m (£3.6m) to combat antisemitism and support victims. Justice Minister David van Weel emphasised that Jewish people must feel safe in their own country and promised to deal severely with perpetrators. However, the chairman of the Central Jewish Committee, Chanan Hertzberger, warned that these measures alone might not suffice. He blamed in part an atmosphere where “antisemitic rhetoric has gone unchecked since 7 October"", adding: ""Our history teaches us that when people say they want to kill you, they mean it, and they will try."" The violence and its aftermath have also exposed political rifts, and some of the language from politicians has shocked the Netherlands’ Moroccan community. Geert Wilders, whose far-right Freedom Party is the biggest of the four parties that make up the Dutch coalition government, has called for the deportation of dual nationals guilty of antisemitism. Both he and coalition partner Caroline van der Plas, among others, have pointed the finger at young people of Moroccan or North African descent. One Dutch-Moroccan commentator, Hassnae Bouazza, complained that her community had for years been accused of not being integrated, and was now being threatened with having their Dutch nationality taken away. Nadia Bouras, a Dutch historian of Moroccan descent, told Amsterdam’s Het Parool newspaper that using the term “integration” for people who had already lived in the Netherlands for four generations was like “holding them hostage”.  “You are holding them in a constant state of being foreign, even though they are not.” The junior minister for benefits, Nora Achahbar, who was born in Morocco but grew up in the Netherlands, said on Friday she was standing down from the government because of racist language she had heard during a cabinet meeting on Monday, three days after the violence in Amsterdam. She may not be the last. Rabbi van de Kamp has told the BBC he is concerned that antisemitism is being politicised to further Islamophobic agendas. He warns against repeating the exclusionary attitudes reminiscent of the 1930s, cautioning that such rhetoric not only endangers Jewish communities but deepens suspicions within society: ""We must show that we cannot be made into enemies.” The impact on Amsterdam's Muslim and Jewish residents is profound. Many Jews have removed mezuzahs - the small Torah scrolls - from their doorposts, or they have covered them with duct tape out of fear of reprisal. Esther Voet sees the emotional toll on her community: ""It’s an exaggeration to say that the Netherlands now is like the 1930s, but we must pay attention and speak out when we see something that’s not right."" Muslims, meanwhile, argue they are being blamed for the actions of a small minority, before the perpetrators have even been identified. Columnist Emine Uğur has herself faced increased threats as a vocal Muslim woman: ""People feel emboldened."" She fears for her son's future in a polarised society where the lines of division seem to be hardening. Academics and community leaders have called for de-escalation and mutual understanding. Bart Wallet, a professor of Jewish Studies at the University of Amsterdam, stresses the need for careful terminology, warning against equating the recent violence with pogroms of the past. Like others, he hopes the violence was an isolated incident rather than a sign of worsening ethnic polarisation. Mayor Femke Halsema is adamant that antisemitism should not be followed by other forms of racism, emphasising that the safety of one group must not come at the expense of another. The violence has left Amsterdam questioning its identity as a diverse and tolerant city. There is a collective recognition, in the Dutch capital and beyond, that as residents seek to rebuild trust, they must address the tensions that fuelled such unrest. Rubbing his hands against the cold, as Amsterdam's cyclists stream by, Rabbi van de Kamp recalls his mother's words: ""We are allowed to be very angry, but we must never hate.""",http://localhost:5000/images/image_14.jpg,C:\Users\compu\Documents\Civitas\flask-server\downloaded_images\image_14.jpg,Politics
15,'A classic left-right era': Labour's big Budget and Badenoch's win reset politics,"With the government announcing big spending and tax, the differences between the two main parties feel sharper, writes Laura Kuenssberg.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8dm4er5rnzo,"“It’s like week zero,” a government insider suggests. A new Conservative leader today. A whopper of a Budget on Wednesday. Add those two events together and it feels like this is the week that everything changed – the clock restarts. The tramlines are now set for the battles ahead, a member of the cabinet tells me. A Labour government that’s now unabashed in the big choices it’s made, the winners and losers they’ve picked. Kemi Badenoch, the new Conservative boss, is unashamed in saying what the softer fringes of the Tory party has felt squeamish about until now. And maybe we’ve entered a new era when the fabled centre ground of politics feels a bit emptier – and the differences between the two main parties are sharper. The consequences of the Budget are still emerging, and the real effect won’t be clear for many months. There has been no huge unravelling, but ministers are still incredibly aware they’ll still need to explain it. If your doorbell rings this afternoon and it’s a grinning person with a red rosette and a leaflet, you’ll know what they’re up to. The party knows the decisions, particularly to whack billions on employers’ national insurance, have caused some anxiety among some voters. This will also hit GP practices and charities, which have flagged fears about the cost of the change - and no government wants to go to war with them. No minister wants to have to defend a decision that looks to many voters and their rivals, like they were misled, after promises not to raise National Insurance in the election. The government rejects the charge - insisting they only promised to not raise the National Insurance paid by employees, rather than employers. But Labour is having to learn what it’s like to take the flak. To wobble on the big decisions would be politically disastrous. And in Downing Street there’s confidence the public is broadly onside. Insiders say No 10’s focus groups - which have been asked about the Budget in the last few days - have understood the decisions, reporting some grumbles but not much sign of outrage. One government source says, “people looked at the Budget and said, ‘that makes sense’. That is a platform we can build on.” The decisions, and the government’s true motivations – are out there now in black and white. The source says “it’s the first time – certainly in government, probably in the whole project – we have been able to show, rather than just tell.” However, after all of Labour’s schmoozing of the business world, and all their emphasis in the election of growing the economy, there’s been some surprise that those arguments were a lot less prominent on Wednesday. Sources say phase one was concentrating on the public finances and public services, then the next part will be more emphasis on growth with a big speech from Rachel Reeves at the Mansion House in the City soon. A senior business leader told me, “they’ve done part one well, in a more traditional Labour way, but to get a real shape, they need a very strong part two... creating the vision, energy and specific incentives and plan for growth and wealth creation – that still needs work.” On the other side, Labour’s union backers are pleased with extra cash for some public services, and the tweaking of the borrowing rules so more money is available to spend on long-term projects. But there’s concern, as one leader puts it, that the NI rise for employers will be “raised in every negotiating room”, as an excuse for lowering wages. And unhappiness on the left about the two-child benefit cap, and the winter fuel allowance, remains - with a judicial review of the decision on those pensioner payments in the offing.  But forget the inevitable skirmishes and stresses. The Budget has filled in many of the blanks about this government, answering part of that common question: what does Keir Starmer really stand for? And the response could almost be a line from a Gordon Brown Budget of days gone by – economic stability, more public spending, with schools and hospitals at the top of the list. Starmer’s backers says the discipline on day-to-day spending - even cuts to some departments - makes it different to Labour Budgets of the past, claiming they have taken the Conservatives’ mantle for being the party you can trust with public money. But no doubt the Budget illuminates the priorities of classic Labour instincts, not the mushy middle. A government source suggests none of it should really be a surprise. “Traditional centre-left arguments were were all there in the election – ending non-doms, VAT on private schools - overall it passes the fairness test and that is the most important thing.” “Labour in its veins,” says a cabinet minister. And in the next few weeks Labour will publish what’s been described as a “programme for government” that will make it even more clear. The sharper shape makes life both easier and harder for the brand new Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch. It’s more straightforward perhaps if Labour’s stripes are more red, the Tories can portray themselves a deeper blue. Kemi Badenoch has been deliberately light on policy, but her principles are clear. She believes in free markets and a smaller state. It’s not going to be hard for her to draw a contrast to the government. “It’s back to the future,” one Tory source tells me. “We can go back to first principles, as we did in the 70s and the early 2000s,” opposing bigger government and bigger taxes. Another senior party figure suggests the Budget has already sketched out an obvious path telling me, “the government has positioned itself as distinctly post-new Labour. “It is workerist, it’s not very nice to farmers or rural areas – with pensioners and farmers you see that you have a coalition where the Tories can get back to 250 seats.” Badenoch’s backers are sure that she can satisfy the first task of opposition, getting noticed. Opposition parties don’t have an automatic right to get attention. One supporter was convinced that “whatever happens, she will be an attention-gatherer.” But Labour reckons their Budget choices have sent plenty of traps for the brand new leader. It might seem natural to the Tories to vote against the government’s tax rises in the Budget. But it’s a lot less comfortable to oppose extra cash for public services. It’s one thing to stand against charging private schools VAT. But will the Conservatives oppose the new teachers for state schools the tax rise is meant to support? That is a far harder argument to make. Labour’s decisions mean, despite Badenoch’s broad-brush approach, the Tories are going to be expected to have something to say about schools and hospitals - services the public relies on. A senior Conservative figure warns that this week has “set up a public services Parliament … you can’t go through a sustained period of time when you just rely on the vibes.” As Chris has written, the task for Badenoch is massive. Not just because of the July’s battering that depleted their numbers so much, but because the Conservatives have been in the groove of attacking each other for many years now. The party is described by sources as “fractious”, and  “deeply sceptical”. Getting rid of leaders became almost the norm. One of the contenders for the job joked when courting votes they’d even been told by one former minister: “I’m more interested in the leadership race in two years time.” Badenoch has won a clear mandate, but by a smaller margin than in races that have gone before. There is no doubt she is a politician that stands out, another Conservative says, referencing an old TV ad: “She has the potential to be Heineken – reaching the parts of the electorate other Tories cannot.” But her style has risks - “like a can of Heineken, if shaken up too much, it can froth everywhere,” and make a terrible mess. Today we start a new chapter. One Conservative source suggests we’re back in a “classic left-right era”. A Labour government that has expressed its priorities with big borrowing, big spending and big tax that believes the public is on board, after years when Budgets at home and in Whitehall have been under so much pressure. And an opposition with a new leader who believes in something completely different. Don’t forget of course the smaller parties, Reform, the Lib Dems, the SNP and Greens, have important roles too. But the contours of the central contest feel sharper now. For years politicians, whether Labour or Conservative, have liked to suggest that we can drift towards lower taxes and still have the kind of public services of countries where the government spends much more cash. Perhaps this week might mark the moment when our politicians stop telling us we can have it all. A former cabinet minister suggests now we’ll be much less like ‘the stepping stone’ between America and the rest of Europe. Politics is an ever-shifting kaleidoscope but Labour’s enormous Budget has set new terms. And with the new Tory leader, we move into a new era.

16,It’s Election Week. Brace Yourselves,The United States will choose between two drastically different futures in the coming days. Here’s what you can expect from WIRED.,https://www.wired.com/story/election-week-brace-yourselves/,"When WIRED launched a politics vertical in January of this year, our decision wasn’t without critics. WIRED is best known, after all, as a “technology publication,” a place that can help you understand the changing landscape of consumer products and technological innovation; one that goes deep on TikTok trends and champions sustainability. We’re somewhere audiences can nerd out over new phones, new memes, new heat pumps. You guys love heat pumps. At the time, though, our decision was firm and our logic was simple: You just can’t unravel technology or science or online culture from politics anymore. We grounded the launch of WIRED Politics in plenty of potential intersections we saw playing out in the year ahead. There was the potential for generative AI to disrupt campaigns and elections, as well as the ongoing influence of disinformation campaigns, and the certainty that we’d see more foreign meddling and hacking exploits like the DNC’s 2015 and 2016 hacks. Not to mention the steady rise of online pundits and influencers, on platforms like Twitch and TikTok, whose voices mattered more to many voters than those of TV hosts or newspaper editorial boards. Ultimately, all of those factors played important roles in this year’s global elections and have been notable to the US presidential race. But at WIRED, tech and politics proved even more interwoven than even we’d expected: Look at the disturbing far-right pivot of some in Silicon Valley’s elite ranks, most notably Elon Musk, who has turned his X account into a megaphone for Donald Trump and opened his vast coffers to move the election in Trump’s favor; consider the devastating implications of Project 2025, a GOP-linked policy blueprint for a second Trump presidency, on everything from climate change to our children’s education; and take note of just how unprecedented both campaigns were in their embrace of influencers and alternative online media to capture potential voters. And now, well, here we are. In the coming days (maybe weeks, hopefully not months), a profoundly polarized country will eke out a decision. The United States will choose its future; one that roughly half this country is almost sure to disavow. If you read WIRED with any consistency, our politics are probably crystal clear to you: A better future, for us, is grounded first and foremost in respect for people—all of them. That means upholding our democratic institutions; it means making an unwavering commitment to human rights and bodily autonomy; and it means recognizing that (no shit!) climate change is an existential emergency. Securing a better future also requires starting from a shared understanding of the present—a framework of reality, of what’s true and what isn’t. It’s something that Donald Trump, the GOP, and the throng of conspiratorial, racist, dangerous enablers who surround them have completely lost touch of, putting this country’s future at great risk. In other words, we’re voting for Kamala Harris. The alternative is a future too abhorrent for even the most dystopian imaginations at WIRED to contemplate.  As for this week: WIRED reporters will be fanned out across the country and covering the election across our digital platforms, including on Instagram and TikTok. David Gilbert will be reporting from the Sun Belt swing states of Arizona and Nevada; Vittoria Elliott will be traveling across Pennsylvania, while Tim Marchman covers the crucial southeastern corner of the state; and Makena Kelly will go where the influencers are—figuratively and literally. Starting today, you can follow WIRED’s election coverage on our liveblog, where we’ll be tracking propaganda, election conspiracy theories, what the major players in tech are doing and saying, and what our reporters are seeing and hearing. Whatever the outcome, WIRED will continue to boldly and fearlessly cover the future as it unspools before all of us—and hold the creators of that future, including our political leaders and governmental institutions, to account. So take the time to vote if you haven’t already, take a few deep breaths if you’ve been holding yours, and together, let’s step into whatever comes next. Please consider subscribing to WIRED.

17,"Ahead of the Election, Social Media Platforms Have Given Up","If you thought 2020 was bad, decisions from Big Tech and the US government have led to an internet that’s even worse off.",https://www.wired.com/story/tech-companies-abdicated-responsibility-for-their-platforms/,"If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism. Learn more. Please also consider subscribing to WIRED Our social media platforms and government have had four years to get this right. Instead, they’ve thrown up their hands. In the days following January 6, Meta, Twitter, YouTube, and Twitch suspended former president Donald Trump over posts the companies said glorified the violence at the Capitol. It was the most extreme moderation decision these companies had ever made. Platforms also took sweeping actions to remove thousands of accounts belonging to militias, conspiracy theorists, and the content they shared that led the US to that moment. But that didn’t last long. It's not your average politics newsletter. Makena Kelly and the WIRED Politics team help you make sense of how the internet is shaping our political reality. After the 2022 midterms, the balance of power shifted in Congress. Republicans now had a majority—albeit a slim one—in the House of Representatives and used that sliver of power to go after the researchers and trust and safety workers who did the dizzying work of debunking election myths. Jim Jordan was elevated to chair of the powerful House Judiciary Committee and immediately launched investigations stifling the work of academics at best and launching harassment campaigns against entire moderation teams at worst. As a result of these attacks, the Stanford Internet Observatory, one of the top disinformation research groups, shut down for good over the summer. Now, much of the social media infrastructure built to protect our democratic systems in the months and days after the deadly riot has collapsed—either by inattention or force. There are only five days left until Election Day and a chasm has formed in what little foundation remains. To start with what we all know: Elon Musk took over Twitter and turned it into X, a conspiratorial wasteland where professional disinformation purveyors earn thousands of dollars peddling lies. Musk reinstated accounts belonging to Alex Jones and Andrew Tate, both of which were banned years before the 2020 election cycle even began. And, to bring us to the present day, Musk has spent the last few weeks campaigning for Trump and spreading election lies. These fissures in platforms have happened across the board. Last year, Alphabet, Meta, and X reduced the size of their trust and safety teams and Meta completely abandoned a project building a new fact-checking tool as a result of cuts. Not only has Meta cast a blind eye to the militias currently organizing on its platforms, it is auto-generating militia-related groups. “To imply that Meta has abandoned its election integrity efforts is absurd and irresponsible as it ignores our work: we have around 40,000 people globally working on safety and security—more than we had in 2020, have grown our fact checking program to more than 100 independent partners, taken down over 200 covert coordinated influence operations, and removed more than a thousand banned militia organizations,"" Meta spokesperson Erica Sackin tells WIRED. Not only are these big tech CEOs revising their moderation policies to allow more trash to find an audience, Trump has recently said that many of Silicon Valley’s wealthiest tech executives have called to suck up to him. “Social media platforms have by and large stopped moderating such content and just as worryingly have cut off researcher access to data streams that allowed us to objectively report on the scale of these campaigns, all due to political pressure on disinformation researchers and social media platforms,” Nina Jankowicz, the Biden administration’s former disinformation czar, told my colleague David Gilbert this week when he wrote about election conspiracy theories and falsehoods already spread unchecked online. Far-right agitators are laying the groundwork for violence and election denial. Fears over noncitizens voting may have led to eligible voters being removed from Virginia’s voter rolls. “The work of studying election delegitimization and supporting election officials is more important than ever. It is crucial that we not only stand resolute but speak out forcefully against intimidation tactics intended to silence us and discredit academic research,” Renee DiResta, former director of the Stanford program, wrote in The New York Times in June. Under the Biden administration, the Democrats fashioned themselves a bastion for deplatforming online bullshit. While a majority of election lies are spread by far-right influencers and activists, the Democrats are beginning to take their role less seriously as well. The Harris campaign rewrote news headlines and ran them as ads on Google, deceptively edited TikTok content, and spent $11 million on a Facebook page to boost positive coverage of the campaign. If you can’t beat ’em, join ’em I guess. If you thought 2020 was bad, all of these decisions have led to an internet that’s worse off than in prior elections. The same bad actors are using the same playbook as before, but the tools to address it have disappeared. After a winner is declared, if that’s next week or months into the future, the next big question will be who will accept the results of the election.

 As you awaken from a night of Halloween debauchery, dressed as a Chipotle fork or a Croc clog or a Stanley tumbler, you'll find you're still haunted — and not by the Hawk Tuah Girl costume or other Spirit Halloween slop. Could it be the statue of a pooped-on Nancy Pelosi desk that's hijacked your dreams? Or the bronze Dwyane Wade that flashes before your eyes when you blink? A fleet of Timothée Chalamet doppelgängers? HIGH CHOCOLATE PRICES?! No, it's probably just the election. Enjoy the quiz.  Loading...

 On a late October evening in North Carolina's capital city, a massive stage in a dark auditorium is backlit by tall screens, and bass-thumping music and vocals are filling the space. There's a table of judges in front of the stage. Think American Idol but with a clearly religious focus. It's worship team audition night at Cross Assembly Church inside the congregation's nearly 1,700-seat sanctuary on a sprawling, multi-wing campus that resembles a high school or community college. This Pentecostal church is led by pastor Chad Harvey, whose sermons — often to weekly crowds of about 3,000 — usually feature on Cross Assembly's social media channels. Harvey says only a small part of his job intersects with politics, but there’s no way to completely avoid political discourse. “If I thought the fate of history depended on the 2024 election, I'd be as anxious as you and popping as many pills you are. Fortunately, I don't believe that stuff,” he said in a sermon posted to social media over the summer. “My hope is in Jesus, not in the politics.” These days, Evangelical and Pentecostal conservatives are a powerful force in Republican politics. And they have stuck by former President Donald Trump for three presidential elections in a row. In fact, in the closing weeks of a tight race in North Carolina, Trump has been appealing directly to religious conservatives. In North Carolina, All Things Considered host Scott Detrow sat down with Harvey and talked about all of this — Trump, religion, politics in general — in a small side prayer room on Cross Assembly's campus. 
                Harvey says there is a misconception that his congregation talks about politics a lot.

 This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity. Scott Detrow: How much does politics come up in day-to-day conversation when you're talking to people here, when you're talking to people in the congregation, when you're doing your pastoral work? Chad Harvey: You know, it's very interesting. I think an outsider looking into the Evangelical Pentecostal movement would assume that politics plays a huge role in the life of the church. It actually doesn't. I'd say 1-2% of my conversations are about politics. I think a lot of people are just trying to make ends meet. They're trying to live their lives. Now, I've told our folks this, you know, our church is accused of being a little bit too political, and I said: “You know, the church is not getting more political, politics is getting more spiritual.” And so we're seeing this infiltration into the political realm of things that used to be the church's territory: family, human sexuality. Now politics is starting to tackle those spiritual issues. Detrow: How do you think about which candidates you are going to support? Is it through the lens of the issues they support? Is it through how they come across as individuals? Harvey: What I've told our congregation is we look at the platform, not the person. And so you can have some people with some pretty deep moral struggles who are upholding a platform that we support. And I tell our people, don't pay as much attention to the struggles — pay attention to the platform. Because here's what the Bible says: There's none righteous. No, not one. We're all messed-up people. So whether it be some of the accusations that have been lodged at (North Carolina Lieutenant Governor) Mark Robinson recently, whether it be Kamala Harris and Willie Brown, Donald Trump telling Howard Stern the sexual revolution of the 1970s was “my personal Vietnam” — they're all messed-up people. And so that's the one thing we have to keep in mind as a congregation. Detrow: Let me just ask the direct question about this with Trump. Donald Trump has such a high support from so many Christians around the country, and yet is somebody who lives in a gold tower with his name on it, who crudely insults people and, among other things, is facing criminal charges. And some people just feel like this is not the message, as I understand it, of Christianity, but there's such a strong support. What's the best way you explain it to someone who says, I just don't understand that?

 Harvey: So I would say, again, I keep going back to we're all messed up people. Trump is messed up. Kamala Harris is messed up. Joe Biden has had accusations thrown at him. We're all messed-up individuals. And so I think what I keep coming back to is a lot of people seem to think that we're having a continuous, 24/7 Trump rally in the Evangelical Pentecostal circle. We're actually not. We're well aware of his foibles. We're well aware of where he's messed up. I think the reason Trump is resonating with Evangelicals is this mess aside that we all know about, the platform he's supporting, like it or not, is closer aligned to our view of scripture than the other side. Detrow: Does that create a world, though, where there's never any accountability for anybody personally? Harvey: I do think that at some point, there will be a line that's crossed. And so at that point, what I said is, sure, that's fine. Let's just make sure we're using that standard across the board. So, “This candidate did this. I can't support him.” That's fine. Don't support him. The only thing I'm asking is to use that same standard. Detrow: You mentioned the lieutenant governor, Mark Robinson. I want to ask about that because I think one of the first things that drew us was that he's spoken to Cross Assembly in the past, and you've gotten to know him a little bit. Harvey: Yeah. Yeah. Detrow: What do you make of him as a candidate and as a man? Harvey: You know, as a man, very winsome. I think one thing that drew him to a lot of individuals in our congregation is we have somebody in high political office who's talking our language. I've said many times about Mark Robinson, for every strength is a corresponding weakness. His strength is he's not part of the political system. The weakness is sometimes he talks like a man who's not part of the political system, and maybe he phrases things that make people uncomfortable. But as an individual, I really feel like the values that he espoused from the pulpit really resonated with our biblical worldviews. Detrow: What I'm hearing is that line hasn't been crossed yet. Harvey: Yeah. ...He did speak at our church, and I think some people see that and say, well, do you view him as a spiritual leader? Well, no, I don't. He's still a political candidate. Detrow: I think we've talked about this in pieces here and there, but I want to give you a chance just to directly talk about it in one swoop. What do you think more secular listeners, listeners of other religious persuasions, listeners who live in other parts of the country — what do you think it is they misunderstand the most about congregations like yours? Harvey: Wow. That's a great question. I would say, again, kind of putting my ear to the ground and seeing what's being said about the Evangelical Pentecostal voting bloc, I think one of the biggest misperceptions is that this is what is dominating our mind. This is what's really driving us. I keep hearing this term, Christian nationalism. That's been the big buzzword in 2024. I've not heard of that until this year that we're just trying to impose our Christian beliefs on this nation and make us a Christian nation. That may be true for other congregations. I don't know that that's true for a large segment of Evangelical Pentecostal Christians. You know, the Bible says, make it your goal to live a peaceful and quiet life. I think a lot of us just want to have a peaceful and quiet life, be able to share the good news of Jesus Christ. I don't think we're driven by this desire to make America a Christian nation, and I don't think politics really occupies as big a part of our brain as people think it does.",http://localhost:5000/images/image_19.jpg,C:\Users\compu\Documents\Civitas\flask-server\downloaded_images\image_19.jpg,Politics

 Earlier this year, Wally Nowinski and his buddy Matt Curry were texting back and forth about what they — two regular voters with no ties to any political campaign — could do to defeat Donald Trump in the presidential election.  ""I'm in California, I could drive to Nevada and knock on doors or something, but I'm not going to reach 5 million people that way,"" Nowinski told NPR. Curry lives in New York.  The two friends work in tech with experience in digital advertising and startups, and Nowinski was particularly interested in what he calls ""sub-prime"" ad markets, aka porn sites.  Political candidates and their allied PACs don't advertise in these spaces because they don't want to associate their brands with explicit content, making the online pornographic market perhaps the last untouched frontier in political advertising.  According to AdImpact, more than $10 billion will be spent in political ads in 2024 in all races across television, streaming, radio and digital platforms.  While advertising in the Philadelphia suburbs, for instance, is quite expensive, ads on porn sites are inexpensive and have almost no competition. ""These ads are like real cheap and it's like weirdly relevant to this campaign,"" Nowinski said.  The relevance they saw was a market they believe can reach one of the key voter demographics in 2024.  ""There’s 3 million non-college white men across the 'blue wall' states, that's a lot of people, and they're probably breaking for Trump like 65-70%,"" he said. ""You only need to make a very few of them change their mind to possibly make an impact on the election."" So Nowinski and Curry did what virtually no regular voters do: They formed a political action committee and raised a modest $100,000. About $25,000 has already been spent in just the last few weeks of October, when inconsistent voters often decide whether to get off the couch or not. Nowinski says their ads have already notched 5 million views.  One of the hurdles was finding pornographic sites that would allow political advertising, which some of the largest distributors of pornography, like PornHub, do not allow. Then, Nowinski said, they had to be able to target the ads in the seven swing states, but with a heavy focus on the ""blue wall"" states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, where larger demographics of white men reside.  The ads are simplistic: a five second static image the viewer must see before they can hit ""skip"" to get to the video they’re there to watch. The image has ominous music and features things like a woman in lingerie with this message: ""Trump’s Project 2025 will ban porn. Enjoy while you can."" The ads also instruct the viewer to ""Google Trump porn ban."" Source: FTW PAC Credit:  FTW PAC Their goal is also simple: Convince some of these Trump-leaning, porn-watching white guys to sit out the election.  ""While this is certainly a different sort of approach, it's not unusual and it's smart in some ways, in a lot of ways it's smart to go where your audience is,"" said Steve Caplan, a professor at the University of Southern California, who is teaching a class this semester on political advertising in the 2024 campaign.  To be clear, Trump has not endorsed a pornography ban, and his campaign has repeatedly distanced itself from the conservative blueprint Project 2025, although it was crafted by Trump allies and it does call for all pornography to be outlawed.  ""I think it's a fascinating example of how far campaign advertising, targeting and hyper targeting has evolved,"" said Caplan.  With $75,000 in the bank to spend by Election Day, Nowinski estimates their swing state ad campaign could hit 20 million views. He also says they'll probably keep the PAC alive after this election, but he's not sure where exactly to take it from here.  ""I'll probably keep the PAC alive because there's other opportunities that are like niche efficiency plays, or kind of unexpected angles that I'd like to explore more potentially in future elections,"" he said.
